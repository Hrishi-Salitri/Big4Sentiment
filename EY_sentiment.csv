You will see a lot people taking transfers to GDS from India practice. The best part is you won’t be working on most of the weekends you are there at GDS.
Opportunity for International Travel - a lot of people get to travel internationally for working with some of the best clients. However, you will have to spend some time with the firm before you get these opportunities. You may have to wait for more than 2 years but not necessarily. I have seen people travelling just within 2 - 3 months of joining. Note that the frequency of travel is less (except for a few), therefore, this is another reason why a lot of people prefer GDS over India practice. Personally I would suggest not to keep this as the main reason for joining the firm.
Integration with the India Practice - A lot of teams such as Advisory ( where I worked for some time) are integrated with the Indian firm, this means you will also get to work for Indian clients wherein you will be in client facing role, which I think is pretty cool.
Cab facility - This is definitely one of the main reasons why I liked this firm. They provide cabs at a very nominal price. Which means you will be spared from driving/travelling in super crowded metro and save at least 3 hours a day (if you are travelling from Delhi). You can use this time to read, sleep, complete your work, etc.","Less Client facing role - Since the firm run on a model of supporting the global teams in their audits/reviews while sitting in India so that the cost of the engagement could be minimized, therefore, there will not be a lot of client facing. However, you will get on a lot of calls with the clients. Most of the people working there do complain about this. Further the firm takes a lot of initiatives to have their employees get exposure of directly working with the client at client location. This includes, integration of GDS with India practice, sending employees on rotation to foreign countries, etc.
Calls - Since GDS works in a remote environment and most of the team members/clients are in a different time zones, therefore, you will be getting on a lot calls at odd hours. I have personally taken calls at around 12 AM. However, the management promotes to not take calls this late in the night. But this is something which is difficult to save yourself from.
Monotonous work - A lot of people complain about doing the same kind of work on a daily basis and start losing their interest. But, if you are one of those who takes initiatives in learning new skills, the management will be more than happy to help you with giving new and different assignments on a frequent basis."

2) Exceptional talent around you that will consistently push you out of your comfort zone. But, you will have to be willing, and wanting to, and make yourself heard. 

3) The flexibility in operation is neat, especially you are a new parent, you suffer illness, or need to pursue studies, or something's just come up that you need to attend to.

4) The in-house technology you need to use on a day-to-day basis is solid. All of us were like spoiled kids when working in the EY office, especially in New York where the headquarters is in the middle of Times Square. 

5) Overall, an incredible place not just to work for several years, but also to get the first five years of your career under your belt if you decide to go work somewhere else to get a different flavor.","1) Given the headquarters is in New York, the whole practice feels very New York based, and of course SFO based. Other offices, naturally, must feel a little left out of the ""club"". 

2) Depending on what group you are a part of, you will naturally have to deal with some workplace politics, conflicting mutual interests, and bothersome and often questionable decisions by the leadership. 

3) While I do not think long hours belong in the cons department anymore, to some, it may. So there it is. You will often work more than 8 hours a day and you will travel for at least 25 to 30 percent a year on average, and this can be a pro for some, like me."

Moreover, E&Y has started a people-focus strategy a few years ago. It started putting a lot of emphasis on its people needs: hiring, training, work-life balance. This strategy has started to pay off as E&Y has won numerous accolades in the press. As I discuss with recruiters, prospective students, or interns, they all confirm that E&Y perception is that of a firm that places a lot of emphasis on its people, which makes it an attractive firm to work for.","While I am overall satisfied working with Ernst & Young, the following could be improved. Travel can be excessive at times (40 - 50%). It is an accounting and consulting firm therefore we have to go where the client goes. I don't think that something could be done but it is good to be aware of the travel requirements, knowing that ones attitude ay change throughout the years (recent hire vs 10 years into ones career).
 Another drawback of working for E&Y is the sales pressure, which significantly increases  in recessionary environment; in other words, sales pressure is the most intense when most of our client are distressed and have little discretionary budget for consultants. This contributes to stress, and sometimes undue competition or tension with one's peers as everybody seems to be competing for the same projects/clients/..."

Job search actually starts here. There are 50% people who leave EY GDS advisory-PI division due to mental harassment, inhuman pressure. 
First they will put you into some client interview. If you can't clear then managements attitude will change. You will be humiliated daily.
Please understand EY GDS is not Big4. They are backend for all EY member firms so expect poor quality work/process.
There is no clear role/career path. For example I was hired as a project manager and I was given the work that a fresher does and was humiliated daily on all nonsense reasons.
Manager and senior manager have monopoly there. If you complain to higher ups against your manager immediately you will get a call from manager with a threat for your complain.

Technically there is no focus. If you are a java resource they will assign you a python project and ask to deliver from next day. Hence, 14-15 hours of work and weekend work is normal here. You will be exploited, humiliated daily.

This is typical bodyshop. If you are ready to face this then please join for few bucks. If you resign they will try to throw some money at your face and shut you up. Don't take this offer else it will be even worse for you.

Favouritism is dominant here. If you are from Kerala by default you are candidate for good rating/promotion.

If you are ready to forget your role in previous company, respect and skill then please come and join.

At least 50% people leave within 6 months and they are OK with it as their project duration is 1-2 week. Within 6 month people work on atleast 3-4 projects. Then again they do a mass hire."

Still, I met some really amazing people who were caught up in the same post grad catch 22 as myself. 

You do receive many of the well respected benefits EY offers such as phone reimbursement and favorable vacation time. 

The main pro is that I now enjoy my current job more because my initial benchmark was set so low with the SDC.","I can not begin to explain the level of dysfunction occurring in this operation. If you are in search of a position which requires critical thinking or creative problem solving, you will be remiss to accept an offer at the SDC. *Click* *Click* *Click* is all you will hear within the office as new college grads mindlessly go through the motions and wonder if all of corporate life shares the same hopeless  monotony. As an escapee, I can assure you, more stimulating jobs await on the other side. Still, one may say, ""EY will look great on the resume"". Let me be the first, and certainly not the last, to tell you; the industry is catching on to our near-shoring operations and the association can tarnish your professional reputation moving forward. Frankly, I made it by the skin of my teeth to a new position due to the negative connotations associated with the SDC. Many of my peers within the ""legitimate"" Big 4 world have shared with me that they have, ""heard it is a blood bath"". 
Anyway, organization within management is nonexistent and extremely political with few clients actually being sold on BAU projects and instead exploiting our low rates for short term contracts. 
Due to the bait and switch qualities of this operation, newly hired grads are almost immediately disillusioned and frustrated right out of the gate leading to a negative environment where people openly speak negatively about the SDC and its components. 
In summation, no collection of words can truly outline my frustration with the SDC's model but I hope the reader understands at this point that they should not accept the offer no matter how tempting the exceptionally low salary (relative to industry standards) is."

He has no respect at all for people's private life and free time, and absolutely delusional expectations that could only work out if you were a robot and had no need for sleeping or using the toilet - however they impose it as standard, making people feel bad about themselves on a constant basis. Sadly as it sounds, they are raising people in the team who follow the same mindset. At the senior consultant level, the rule is to play the manager role, deliver at the best quality but only charging half of your time and spending extra-time in the office to cover up for the time you could not charge, so we all burn out pretty quickly.

When my offer letter was presented to me I was told that I would not be eligible for EYs paid maternity leave due to the fact that although they had acquired a company that I had been employed at for five years, I hadn't been an EY employee yet for 12 months. Disappointing but I could live with it. Over the next month I repeatedly asked HR about the FMLA qualification which is also based on 12 months of employment, Short Term disability eligibility or loss of, lost PTO with the acquisition etc. I basically wanted to know if I was getting 6 weeks unpaid or 3 months unpaid after my baby was born so I could plan accordingly. I was told each time that I could not engage with EYs maternity team until the deal closed. Time was ticking on and the stress of not knowing during my pregnancy was just too saddening - I knew I had to leave the company for my own health. I quickly found a new job at a company that went out of their way to treat me like one of their own and while I disqualified from both FMLA and short term disability I knew I could never trust Society nor EY if I stayed. 

Fast forward three weeks after leaving the company, a dozen emails later and I am sitting pregnant without health insurance. Neither company will give me access to Cobra that I've repeatedly asked for. Cobra told me I'm not in their system. I'm paying out of pocket for my ultrasounds and praying that nothing happens to me. Only one week to go until my new coverage kicks in. Unfortunately health insurance companies won't provide short term coverage to pregnant women so I'm out of luck. 

Shame on them."

Each day is a new learning experience. It strives to work accross borders in more effective ways than its competitors. The partners recognise the need for work/life balance and empathise but they rely on getting the maximum hours out of their people to keep their incomes in the top echelons of society so they dont speak back.,"The US firm now dominates the other practice areas and the American implants sent to run the overseas operations have very limited local knowledge and cultural awareness. This means that decisions are often made out of ignorance of how markets and legislation operate in local theaters. I hear frustration from EY people that the rules are:

The American way is the right way
The American way is the only way.
It works in The States so it must work here.

Guys - the prices in Europe are not in USDollars, we have our own laws and customs - and so do our clients!  Local customs prevail and the loss of clients in the local marketplace is down to the cultural schism between the unelected US leadership and the local staff and partners. The US leaders are just visiting and have no real interest in the values and long term performance of the European firms."

- 401k match is one of the worst available
- no gym reimbursement
- forced to travel with little to no notice, months at a time
- the ""people first"" culture that they emphasize to potential candidates is non-existent...well unless you count the partners as people
- very little minority representation at partner level

Basically, every hour worked by an EY employee brings in x dollars to EY. Employees get a flat salary w/ no bonus. Therefore, to make the most money, it's best to keep staffing low and just produce the most work out of the limited resources available. So if you work 100 hours in a week, you are bringing in a lot of money for the company...none of which you will see a single penny of. This is great for the greedy partners, but what can you do..."

This was after they made them wait for 2 hours. How will you rate such an organization?

People with prior BIg4 experience and having a decent work experience were merely given a choice that they could stay if they were interested in the 3 months' contract or leave if they are not interested. Despite the candidates telling them that they've been explicitly told that they will be offered permanent positions. Humiliation to the candidates that's it. The HR absolved themselves of any responsibility saying it is the recruitment consultants fault while the recruitment consultant said that they acted just like the EY GSS team asked them to.

However, considering the extortionate fees charged by the firm, it is certainly not good value. Rates charged by the firm for a senior consultant, even after a ""discount"", are unjustifiable. 

2. EY's idea of a training and development consists of accountancy training for those who are aligned to a graduate scheme. For those who are experienced hires, EY subjects them to a series of repeating courses on problems solving and communication; both of which should be standard for any employee anyway. There is little or no real training for experienced hires and technical skills development never happens.  

3. Generic managers and senior managers love to spend their time documenting and producing PowerPoint presentations to ""impress"" the client, while its the senior consultants and consultants who complete the tangible work of any real value to the client. 

4. EY reserves the right to retract any holiday approval even AFTER the holiday has been booked without paying for the holiday cancellation costs. It's rare, but it can happen since there is no protection afforded by HR. This can leave you out of pocket or out of a job. Hugely unfair and unprofessional. 

5. Pay is above average, but not enough given the number of hours worked and effort."

You will come to the office see some nice people and if you decide to come you will be disappointed. There is one major project in the center that dominates the firm- if you are not on this project you are SCREWED and if you are- you are SCREWED. So either you work long hours for little pay - 40k remember that. Or you are benched for 8 months out of the year- real EY people will say that is because they are trying to push you out. NOT- actually i received a very good review and a 4k raise and 2k bonus- WHAT DOES THAT DO FOR ME- NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. What they are doing at this center should be a crime.

Resourcing is a joke - there is zero attempt to understand skillsets of individuals, assuming that everyone is homogeneous.

Admin is pathetic - the HR function is incompetent and unable to do anything without constant haranguing.

When challenged, they push back and eventually may escalate, at which point radio silence ensues."

Hence only Support staff at the EY office get this perks which is really quite annoying given the client facing roles actually bring in revenue.
Have never felt so unvalued by any company, forced to do junior tasks without any regard of previous experience. 
The most important KPI is bringing in more revenue with team management etc. being practically ignored.
The EY internal systems are shocking especially given we are advising companies on how to implement better internal processes and systems. At EY there is absolutely no regard for consultant's time and it is treated as ""free"", hence no incentive to improve systems and processes given its only the staff's free time which suffers. 
Have worked on engagements where EY consultants are charged out as 8 hrs per day however we only get paid for 7.5. Working overtime is fine if there is a need for it however to force people to work 2.5 hrs of overtime EVERY week for no reason is surely illegal? On engagements where excessive overtime is required to finish the project, consultants are forced to only add 7.5 hrs to timesheet despite 15 hrs worked as it otherwise decreases the Partner Margin on the engagement. Its not that you would be paid for 15 hrs anyways however Utilisation is another key metric so if you happen to be a few weeks on the bench you can't reach your Utilisation targets anymore. Plus we read so much in the media about how franchises use employees and force unpaid or even undocumented overtime, what about consulting??"

The job descriptions can be enticing with core technical responsibilities listed but the actual day-to-day work may not even be close. Classic data scientist's expectation vs reality disappointment.
2. They advertise being cognizant about the environmental impact of traveling in consulting industry. But, project teams require you to make totally unnecessary and avoidable air travels, with the excuse that they still have budget to spend on air and hotel tickets.
3. Be great at showy/shiny powerpoints otherwise you are frowned upon. Presentation is literally everything they care about.
4. Requests for flexible work environment and meaningful work that can advance technical careers go completely unhindered. Leadership only cares about making their practice profitable, No matter what happens to an individual's careers.
5. Everyone is in a rat race of becoming a manager. So individual career aspirations (w.r.t technical skill set) take a back seat and all you are expected to do is network, be well-known in your practice and work towards being a manager.
6. There are some great people but unfortunately I only got to work with toxic people who micromanage, gossip every second, pass detrimental comments and create utterly toxic work environment.
7. This is not a tech firm. No best practices or quality data products being developed. No real data science guidance or oversight available. There is an elite group in D&A practice doing advanced analytics work. Everyone else is at a disadvantage from data science perspective. Data Scientists beware - before joining, confirm that you are actually going to do the work mentioned in the job description."

Consulting/Advisory is what is going to drive revenue over the next decade and leadership refuses to stop setting strategy and business policies focused on the Audit/Tax groups.

- We pay our own Amex bills, meaning if the firm disagrees with an expense, you pay it out of pocket until they deign to acknowledge it was a legitimate expense. Everyone I know has had to pay business expenses out of pocket with no hope of reimbursement due to the antiquated policies.

- Senior Managers and Partners are absent at best and yet live with God complexes that derails projects whenever they decide to give even 50% of their attention to the work at hand. Feedback is one way, meaning no one above a Manager can provide feedback on leadership. Additionally, company wide feedback is completely subjective, making end of cycle variance volatile and comparing individuals nearly impossible. 

- Projects are consistently understaffed in order to offer deals to clients so they pick EY instead of competitors as they are well aware that our reputation is not the best in the business, or even the Big 4. Work/life balance is a myth, and if you try to set boundaries you are punished."

I will not go into detail but you would certainly not want to be faint hearted.

Some things are as simple as having to deal with technical support in a different location, while at other times it may be due to a difference in ideology; big vs. small, profit vs. compassion."

All of this is great if you want to because you want to make partner one day because they want you to succeed and generate lots of money for the firm, but all of this is not great if you just want to do a good job but don't want to work a bazillion hours of overtime and want to be able to pick up your kid by 5pm without having to tuck him in at 8pm and join a call at 10:30pm--this is what they mean by flex work arrangement.  I've seen coworkers on ""flex work arrangement"" work nearly 40 hours every week but only getting paid 60% because they have to ""keep up"" with their workload because there is no one else to do it and the demands to complete work and remain profitable are great.  Not my idea of flex work arrangement, it's almost like bait and switch.   After doing taxes for 15+ years, and grueling tax seasons year after year, I'm tired of it.  The processes are extremely bureaucratic and what should only take in essence 5-7 hours to do all aspects of a return, takes 20 hours because of all the admin, billing and coordination involved to comply with national processes.  People I work with are great, but the pressures to advance and the stress from nonstop work culture of this place will make any work/life balance difficult."

People are very reluctant to provide negative feedback or to deal with conflict, and it becomes a very difficult process to eke out concerns or negative feelings.  Instead, people respond very passively and avoid important issues.  Management is very slow to respond to personality problems, unless there is a clear-cut case of bias, discrimination, etc.  Otherwise they just shy away and hope the problem disappears, or delays decisions through committee.  Management has a very hard time articulating strategy on a broader basis - instead it is dealt with on a sale-by-sale basis and is done in a manner that resembles groping about in the dark.  Very few people can even articulate what is unique about E&Y vs. competition in a meaningful and compelling way - usually it is just  a recital of basic facts about the company.  Cost structure is too high and EY usually gets killed on rates vs competition...lots of dead wood in the partnership who are unprepared to deal with change...they tend to just defend old ways until biz underneath them evaporates and is gone."

Being made a partner, however, will depend on lots of factors outside of your control.  

Great starting place for a job as an accountant or controller or even CFO at another company.

This is a premier company from a global perspective. No question one of the strongest companies in the industry, though that doesn't necessarily translate to being a fun company to work at. 

They pay for your CPA degree and even provide a bonus for passing it early.  

If being an accountant is your dream, you can't go wrong with EY.","If you do not want to be an auditor or tax accountant or accounting consultant, stay away. Don't even visit their webpage. 

This company is about doing an adequate amount of work in as many hours as possible in order to bill the client roughly what was billed in the past and work toward billing more in the future.  Creativity is stifled. I was told, very specifically by a manager, that auditors are not there to ""help"" the client, but merely to verify that they are doing what they say they are doing.  It is a babysitter's job.

Very simple tasks (like comparing numbers in multiple documents) are made extremely convoluted and time consuming.  Everything has to be done in a particular order because the whole process is regulated, and that is understood, but time-saving measures are not encouraged.  

Face time is very important. The intern doesn't leave before the associate, who stays until the senior associate is gone, who won't move without knowing the manager is gone, who doesn't budge until the senior manager is gone. The senior manager lives in fear of the partner, and so he works all night.

In all honesty, it is important work, and certain people are cut out for it, but if you like your creativity, and if you don't like the thought of working 80 hours to do a 40 hour job don't work at a Big 4 firm like EY.  

If you value money early in your career and are smart enough to get this job out of college, don't get this job out of college. Pay is insulting after the wining and dining they do during on-campus recruiting. Benefits are stingy."

If you can take the grind, you can get pretty far and it opens a ton of doors when it comes to furthering your career.","Work-life balance is terrible. I don’t know of any office job where the expected hours per week are 45. Your workload completely rests on how realistic your client’s and managers’ expectations are, which in some cases includes working in the evenings, in unbilled hours “just to make sure the client is happy.” But here is the real reason why I give EY 2 stars. During my time at the firm, my wife had our fist child. EY gives 2 weeks parental leave to the nonprimary caregiver before their 1-year anniversary, but after a year, that becomes 16 weeks, paid.
My child was born, prematurely might I add, at 9pm on the evening before my one-year mark. I reported to work on that day. I put in the hours for a full year’s worth of work, and my kid was born after hours. However, they flat out refused to give me the time off, citing that “there is a precedent.” So I had a kid in the NICU and the company that “looks after their people” did not do squat to give me a little bit of flexibility in terms of giving my wife a break or giving me some appropriate time to bond with my child. 
That was the moment I decided I was leaving the firm, and the moment I became completely disillusioned in the work there. They are just like any other company that slaps these “generous benefits” on their HR sites and hiring materials to make you think they care, but when the time comes to have a human being give you some real help, they just won’t go beyond the agreed-upon minimum. They don’t care about you."

Lots of soft skill learning available

Business services are responsive and helpful

Powerpoint skills are now through the roof. You will learn how to align all the shapes.","If you are hired as an experienced professional, then it doesn't matter what you did previously, you will be put on whatever engagement is available across the advisory business and that can be anywhere in the UK/abroad on short notice for long periods of time. It usually works out as a horrible game of pass the parcel, so make sure you have a good reason ready to try and avoid it being you

If you do not have a Partner who will back you up, you are at the mercy of the resourcing staff. 

When you are parachuted into a completely new subject area, if you succeed, then it's EY's success, if you struggle then it's you the individual who is to blame.

If you try and avoid that situation, you are called 'inflexible' and placed onto a Performance Improvement Plan 'to improve your consulting skills' i.e. the art of winging it when you don't know the subject area.

If you try and tell your Counsellor or Pod Director you are in the wrong team as you are being put on engagements that are not relevant to your experience, then you will be reassured and then ignored. See previous paragraph.

Team mates/colleagues will point blank ignore you before and after you have served a specific purpose that benefits them. Be ready for plenty of awkward lift rides. 

As such, there is next to no team spirit. EY have recognised this by trying to assign each other 'buddies' and 'family trees' forcing people to try and become friends with each other.

Your half year and year end reviews happen in a meeting you are not invited to. The scores you collate from your peers are rejected and your actual performance is decided by people who have next to nothing to do with you. 

I didn't actually learn anything new about my subject area during my time with EY. I solely relied upon my previous knowledge (when it was even relevant to my work).

Also, it takes 5 years to get to be a manager where I have this much flexibility. The first few years are tough. Auditing is not that glamorous. I might have more fun doing something completely outside of the corporate world., but this allows me to have money and lots of vacation to do the things I want to do outside of work.

EY still widely considered as an auditing firm, doesn't have as much weight in resume as people think

Work-life-balance; the nature of business (whether you work for buy-or sell side, project usually must be carried in ~4 weeks. This means that usually you will tbh work 70-100 hrs week depending on a project)

Partners don't care about their employees, only about their bonuses

On manager level, people are only interested in minimising their own work and outsourcing their work to juniors. 

Really generalistic function. You will not become a specialist (other than a specialist in transaction and M&A) in any specific industry. Considering that most companies don't execute transactions quite often, except PE firms, IMO you really can't leverage your skills outside the firm.  Surely you gain the infamous ""consulting mindset"", but that is obtained after couple of years.

Considering the hours, the pay is not worth it.  Over hours are recorded and paid out every 6 month, or you ""can"" use them for vacation time on 1to1 basis."

First, the consulting practice doesn't have enough projects or the right projects to keep people busy.  A lot of Senior Consultants ended up working on internal projects or pursuits, for a long time.  You learn little during the time.  
Second, some senior managers are really far from the culture that EY is proud of (supportive and collaborative).  You are mostly treated as a labor to work day and night, 7 days a week, without being appreciated.  You feel you wouldn't trust these people.  If you have a review with them, you feel your results and evaluations has been set up even before they listen to you.   It also means if they got a project, someone else will be considered even if you worked very hard for them and tried to please them. 
Third, make sure you select the office which matches your interest focus.  Each office may have different focus even within one practice.  If your interest is different than the office's focus, you will not get project from your office and have to follow someone else from a different office and fly every week for other projects."

The Flexibility is something I am grateful for.  Some examples of Flexibility are: 1) being able to work remotely when needed,  2) being able to go to the doctors appointment without having an approval. You make your schedule (within reason) as long as you get your work done.

There is Very minimal micromanagement as long as you get your work done.  Flexibility and minimal micromanagement are the top two things I've been able to distinguish EY from other Big 4 firms.

Very little work/life balance for those looking to raise a family and have a life outside of work."

Additionally, a lot of the new hires and I were misled into thinking ""Advisory"" meant strategic business consulting, but it actually means either IT or financial auditing, depending on where EY decides to place you. The word ""auditing"" was NEVER thrown around during the recruiting process, and I would never have chosen to apply for the job had I known what it truly was. ALSO, one engagement I was on involved working in a trailer with no windows, no cell phones, and literal mice scurrying around and leaving droppings on the desks (which were already covered with dust and dirt to begin with), basically causing every day to become a Clorox-fest along with the 12 or 13 hours of IT auditing fun (I only worked eight, because I was planning to quit at that point and stopped caring, and was laughed at and frowned upon for this!). That being said, I also had some good experiences, getting to travel to various places in the country on some engagements (including NYC and Philadelphia), and working with some really great, smart people. I think it's possible to have a good experience here, but it's hit-or-miss, and you have to sort of wheedle your way into the good engagements and projects or else you will get stuck in something bad!"

Learned next to nothing in my years here except ppt and Excel, most of which I already knew before coming in. Training is a farce. They don't teach you how to think as other mgmt consulting firms do because you actually have no need in day to day work. No mentorship either. Thank goodness I know how to code, otherwise don't know how my skills will be transferable to anything else.

2) Lots of Politics
Lots and lots of politics. A - - kissing is a must. People don't care about you or your career growth just about covering their own behinds and how to make themselves look good.

3) Rewards Mediocrity and Shuns Excellence
As you go along you will see many smart people in the junior positions that filter out when you get to higher mgmt levels (manager, SM etc). This is not a coincidence. It's because of the aforementioned politics and general culture that rewards mediocrity and shuns excellence. Smart people tend to ask questions and voice their opinions when they think there is a better solution but you will find here that that is discouraged. It's expected that you just 'do your job' and 'don't ask questions' even when what your mgr is doing is clearly wrong and a day later you have to undo what you did and go in a different direction. 

4) Body Shop Projects
A lot of projects, esp in FS advisory is centered around big banks and AML. These are the most boring projects ever and you will find yourself repeatedly doing things even a monkey can do. The only reason they ask EY to do it is because EY has the brand name and since its primarily an audit firm it is 'trustworthy'. The reason why EY staffs so many of these projects instead of automating is because they can earn more $$ on each resource"
