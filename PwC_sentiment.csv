- Talent attraction: generally pretty smart and highly educated colleages. 
- Good/big clients: Usually FTSE 250 or similar global.
- Nice offices in London
- Fairly innovative with some good frameworks and IP","- Broken performance management and moderation process: It's not about quality of feedback but about quantity. People cheat the process by getting performance reviews from ""buddies"". If the feedback does not come from a Partner, or from an influential Director, it does not count. Also, it's tacitly accepted that one shouldn't really say any real development areas in their feedback. e.g. I was once given really good feedback, but this person didn't include any 'development' points in it because ""they would use it against me in moderation"".
- A culture that rewards wrong/less valuable behaviours: visibility and popularity is much more important than quality of delivery. It almost looks like quality, techical acumen, are very low in their scale. 
- At least in my experience I had two very unenthusiastic and untrustworthy People Managers. They completely set me up for failure when not being transparent about the culture of the firm mentioned above. 
- Pay is the lowest amongst the Big 4s, pretty tough to live in London with PwC salaries. But the talent and work is in London, so they should try to pay for it. Sad bonus scheme, and zero chance of getting a payrise if you don't get promoted.
- Greedy: The UK Partnership is among the most profitable of the PwC firms. This is on the expense of low pay to staff. How can they justify that the Avg Partner profit is 12 times a Mgrs salary? It's also around 6-7x a Director's salary. Is a Partner's value added 6-7x of what a Director brings? I am not sure. While Partners are in general hard working individuals, most of their role is Sales. Is an experienced Sales person paid 6-7x times more than a delivery person in other companies? Don't get me wrong, all Partners are in general fairly well experienced leaders that definitely made it there for a reason. I just think they could adjust their disposable income to level de staff's pay with the market.
Surely they are not in PwC just for the money? (At least that's what they preach to staff)"

- No real clarity in performance appraisals system. Tendency to give middle of the road 3/5 scores with little explanation.

- Inflexibility both inside and outside of busy season. I know several colleagues working 14 hour days regularly between Jan - April. 

Stressful environment in general. Higher levels of management CONSTANTLY emphasise innovation and creativity while there is often no scope to apply to jobs. Many processes in your first two years of joining are labour intensive while you're often criticised for not completing at an unnatural rate of progress.

I've found management to be lacking in basic people management skills in general. The default approach is to belittle aloud in front of peers. Several managers have become known for this approach. No recognition of difficulty in reporting and ameliorating the situation. It's simply considered your misfortune while you risk diminishing your reputation.

HR department rather ineffective. Initiatives rarely touch base with employees, while employee training sessions are largely known as a significant waste of time. Little specific department training.

Most significant of all is the general lack of appreciation and value. New employees can be frequently derived and are there's a significant morale problem."

Set a precedence and balance for yourself early on and try not to compromise other than when going the extra mile is warranted for client delivery/satisfaction.

PWC is synonynmous with encouraging scoundrels, spineless and absolutely untrustworthy employees up the hierarchy, which only promotes such tendencies in the team
2. Genuine people who join this otherwise hollow company, are fooled by HR into believing they are walking into a dream-land, where as the truth cannot be further from the fact. Starting with HR - they believe that they are actually doing a favor  by offering a job offer to prospective employees and have a ""take it or leave it"" attitude, which only smacks of down-right arrogance, absolutely down market corporate upbringing and attitude, which possibly stems from the over-inflated egos and packages of the IITs and IIMs who are hired in this company - who have absolutely no sense of ground reality.  Every partner here in PwC seems to be suffering from a deep sense of insecurity, malice and toxicity and if they feel a threat to their position - even from a junior person, they make the life of the other person hell.. by constantly discouraging, be-littling, down-grading and demeaning.  
2. PwC encourages a** - lickers, the more you lick the more you get - which means, irrespective of the knowledge and hard work - PwC values such tendencies, guess this is a fall over from the socialist india in the 1980s when these tendencies were rampant - PwC and probably the likes of it in the Big 4 space, dont deserve to even exist - what is the value they actually add to the economy? 
4. One of the most hypocritical and horrible set of people in this company who do not have other work than to pass snide remarks, judgments, build concretized false perceptions and ideas, keep pulling down and degarding - guess it comes from the fact that most Indians are cowards, no self-esteem, no spine and certainly no respect for the employee\

If you are paired with a good team,  you can work with some really nice  people who take time out to help you with an issue.","This is by far one of the worse companies I have ever worked for. How are you number one in the industry? It makes me think that some of these reviews are not 100% honest and that is horrible for people who depend on these reviews on Glassdoor when making a decision to apply. Some of the employees with a ""title"" are a set of the most unprofessional people imaginable. Training is subpar at best and the managers are clueless that their employees are being treated unfairly in their department(s). PwC reels you in with promises and everything that you want to hear to get you to accept the position. Once you are hired, the game changes and all bets are off.

Accept the position only if you have no other alternative. Most importantly, if you have an issue, personal or professional, do not go to HR. They make you fill out a survey and whatever you discuss in ""private"" is included in the notes of the survery. No one there is to be trusted as the ""coach"" that you are assigned to spies on you and runs back to report. 

Any time you call anyone for assistance, you fill out a survey. If you don't fill it out within the hour, you get a call asking you why you didn't fill it out. If you give any rating under ""satisfactory"" you get another phone call asking you why you didn't give a higher rating. You feel pressured into giving good reviews even when your issue hasn't been resolved. 

Intimidation and threats to be given a low score on your ""progress report"" if you don't ask ""how high"" when told to jump is the norm. My advice? Go in and do your time if you must. It looks good on your resume. But if you can, run and never look back after you have been there long enough to add them to your portfolio. Good luck!"

You can sit back and take the slow, easy road, or you can take opportunties to step up and advance quickly.  Recognition is given for the work you can perform, not the years you have been around.  There are numerous opportunities to try new areas and training is provided before taking on this new task.  Some of these rotations are short (6 months) while others go for a year or more.  It's also great that it is a global organization and international transfers, domestic rotations, etc are available and fairly easy to obtain.  I transferred between offices and the transition was a breeze!","Work/life balance is hard to find.  Accounting used to be thought of us a job with certain busy times of the year, generally in the spring and again in the fall.  These days it seems that it is always busy and there is never a break.  Working 80 hours a week over and over again with pay that while seems great at the beginning, diminishes significantly with every additional hour worked.  One of the other big issues is that there is so much administrative work, its hard to find the time to do any real work.  We are so bogged down with risk management issues, checklists, time reporting, scheduling, etc that real work comes later and pushes the hour threshold yet again."

Management expects a lot out of employees, but is not willing to give or be understanding of employees' needs.  PwC makes a big deal out of the whole ""work-life balance"" idea, but that's just lip service.  Sure, they give you the opportunity to take time off and work 4 tens during offseasons.

2) Toxic team culture. You might bump into a really bad team and have a miserable work life every day. (I witnessed a guy who quit within two months after being employed, I still don't think it's the staff's issues as of today.) 
3) 100 hours per week during busy season is an norm. The length of busy season and the amount of hours depends on your team. I know some people on my team literally enjoy the busy time, I personally don't. The promotion of ""Be Well Work Well"" is a joke. Some of my peers could easily continuously on busy season mode for most part of the year, tell me how to be well in that situation while you have no WLB, facing a bunch of folks who don't really value your existence.
4) Bad start on the team means you're pretty much screw over, good luck if your senior is not helpful. And get ready to pack if she/he doesn't like you for some reasons. 
5) Your personal life issues wouldn't be considered as part of your performance even though they look like they care at first. In fact, they expect you to be robots, no emotion, nothing would interrupt your work even if you're sick, they won't take into account that this might impact your quality of work because you're a robot, which shouldn't be affected by anything in your personal life.
6) The firm has an inclusive culture doesn't mean your team is inclusive. Last year I seek out for mental advice because I could not feel myself anymore.
7) No tolerance for mistakes, you're expected to be perfect.
8) Favoritism. Get ready to wear that mask if you're not an natural of complimenting your boss to get an easier life at work."

- Onsite travel policies are not good at all.. not a place for onsite
- While in notice, treating employees is not good
- Management does not interfere in any project related activities..
- It is more like a body shopping company.
- Onsite insurance is mere waste.
- Reimbursement process is not easy and is a great inconvenience for professionals.
- All projects are partner based.. more focused on billing, and margin.

So, SDC has equal pros and cons. Up to the individual to decide. Somebody who is a technology freak this is not a good place. If somebody likes a cool place irrespective of the work, this is a place. Job is stable for full time guys. Follow with your manager and enjoy your stay."

2. My own management team was excellent; assignments were challenging, and management appreciated my contributions.
3. The deserving clients with whom I worked needed our help, and like my management, appreciated our team's contribution to improve their processes and performance.","I was not impressed by corporate PwC:
1. The headquarters politics and the broadcast communications of the firm were very politically correct.  Their particular flavor of political correctness had the feel of a ""cynical embracing"", rather than actual enthusiasm, which would have been easier to appreciate and/or understand.
2. The Annual Review process was very opaque.  One is evaluated by a committee of people that have not met or worked with the reviewee; they do not know what the reviewee does, except for the broadest strokes. Mechanical measurements are emphasized over one's own management's evaluations.  The focus, even at the non-managerial level of Senior Associate, seemed to be on business development, rather than task performance.
3.  Work-life balance.  Across the firm, PwC has a culture of heavy overtime, especially for Managers and above.  In fact, if one chose to balance work and life, it was likely to be reflected negatively in one's next assessment cycle.
4. There was minimal support to team members at remote or smaller offices.  PwC places an enormous emphasis on meeting the annual training requirements.  However, almost no classroom training of any kind was offered locally (in my smaller market office), and despite plenty of technology, the firm does not offer much in the way of distance learning for the Advisory government consultants.  Most of the training available were self-study online courses.  While the Skillport online classes are adequate as familiarization or reinforcement to certain  business subjects, an actual instructor, as well as classmates with experiences to share, are much more valuable.
5. PwC's corporate financial systems were hard to access, confusing, and time-consuming to use (timesheets, expenses, travel systems)."

The firm offers week long (off-site) training sessions specific to your line of work, online tutorials, teleconference seminars, IT Learning & Education, and numerous other ""education"" opportunities. Additionally, as you move up in the firm, there is coaching geared specifically for the management level and above.
PwC is also great for meeting people and developing a network. There are lots of knowledgeable, well-connected people there who are usually willing to include you in their circle of friends.
For the most part the leadership is part extremely qualified, treats everyone with respect (even new associates/new hires), and will recognize a job well done.
The firm tries to communicate clearly with its employees, and if anything, there is so much communication that it is impossible to keep up with it all.
More than anything, the people you work with can be the best part of the job.","I believe that management has been ordered to work new hires to death. Since pay is salaried and there isn't really overtime (maybe a spot bonus here and there), i think the motto is ""milk them for all they're worth"". As a new associate you will be told that you are expected to work long hours and to have a ""utilization rate"" of at least 80% according to HR policies. That being said, however, as a new hire a likelier story is that you should really be at 100% since other people in the office have utilization rates of up to 150% (or something ridiculous like that). If you have 8hrs of billable hours a day you have a 100% utilization rate, so you can do the math to figure out what 150% would be. ""It's not uncommon to work 12-14 hours a day"", according to many managers. And if you ask, like me, how does that leave time for the rest of your life?? You might get a similar answer- ""well, the work has to get done"". Work/Life Balance is a joke!

Also, the push on new hires comes from the fact that they have the lowest billing rate and budgets are ALWAYS tight. That can be pretty stressful.

So again, the biggest downside would be the long hours. VERY LONG HOURS. If you are okay with that for the rest of your life, and especially as a new hire, then PwC is the place for you. But be aware, for the amount of time you work, the salary isn't that high and the spot bonuses for overtime are weak to say the least.

The last thing is that sometimes credentials take precedence over proven abilities. So much emphasis is placed on PhDs and advanced degrees, but having those degrees does not necessarily make the person the best one for the job or even the smartest (it seems like every one at the office is always having to prove how smart they are!). I'm extremely proud to work for PwC and with the people there, because i think they really are very talented and bright, but sometimes it goes to their heads. Eh, most of the time maybe..."

I am a white male and was passed over to make up for under representation with racial minorities and females.  I agree the firm's partnership was overly dominated with white male, but the solution should be to remove the underperforming and make room for those that are make the firm's money and reputation.  Also the closer you get to partnership the more you realize that most of the partners are really highly paid staff without any control, input or decision making authority.

Net net...
I recommend consulting to anyone early in their career who receives an offer, but does not have a professional passion that they would regret NOT pursuing instead

If you decide to go into consulting...
Make your decision based on the quality of the partners/team you will work with. They will greatly impact your career growth and how much fun you will have. 

If you don't have the opportunity to interview directly with your future teams than I'd recommend MBB > Big 4 > Niche. But IMO you will make faster gains in a great situation at a less prestigious firm than they will make in an average situation at a more prestigious firm.","1. Although work/life balance is championed, it is not culturally understood
2. Comp for is formulaic and cohort-based below director-level; top-performance is ranked but not (significantly) rewarded
3. PwC is not perceived to be as sexy as MBB

Risks
1. Career growth and/or quality of life will be a function of the partners you work under; some people get lucky and others get screwed
2. If you don't have a skill that differentiates yourself from the crowd you will be a commodity and you will not work on stimulating projects that will advance your career"

Every year, January, February, and March were hellacious. In 2017, I worked 52 consecutive days from Jan 3 to Feb 23, with many days involving 10-14 billable hours. This included seven consecutive weekends. I averaged 65+ billable hours per week. With a year-round client that's an SEC registrant, work-life balance continued to be bad in the quarterly review months of April, July, and October. Therefore, take 3 months of busy season, plus 3 more months of quarterly reviews, and 6 months of the year I rarely had flexibility. My mental, physical, and emotional health deteriorated; I was becoming a one-dimensional person with limited time to invest in family, friends, hobbies, or physical exercise. I started a new job with a non-Big Four accounting firm 2.5 months ago, and my work-life balance and happiness are significantly better. The grass is truly greener on the other side.

Also, if you muck up once, “everyone talks” and nobody will want you as part of the team or leading the team. Unless you can get a good coaching family/manager that will stand up for you (most of these guys are too busy to really help), you won’t go far either.

They push people into doing free overtime whilst they charge the clients higher fees for this overtime. Expect to be working with unrealistic deadlines so that managers can maximise profits. Be careful on the term and conditions of the employment contract as PwC will  make everything to trap you for their benefit. Bonus for an associate in assurance is £150 and that's a real example. Coffee chains pay more in bonus to their employees. The job in audit is pointless and extremely boring. It adds no value to any client. PwC spends so much money on PR to present itself as the  elite firm but inside is rotten. So overall a big mistake to join this firm.

That can include long periods of working from home, coming into the office later in the day, taking multiple coffee breaks, etc. The mindset is that if the work gets done and is of great quality, individuals should continue to be rewarded with as much flexibility as they need to succeed.

U are always making up time - if u go on sick day or a volunterring activity, u are expected to make up for the hours u missed even though it was not your fault.

Staffing of jobs is terrible - the charge out rates are unrealistic, they are never recoverable from the client. Jobs are frequently understaffed just so that recovery can look better  for the partner on the job.

U are expected to work on weekends - personal life suffers massively, on top of this u don't get paid.

U are expected to contribute to the firm initiatives even though you are on dirt pay, and there is no incentive to drive the process."

- No rewards, no outing parties.

- No transportation facility

- Managers are so dumb that they start hiring a technology person if client named a technology but once the project starts hired person will get to know that technology is no way related the project and client have used it in past.

Seniors wait until late in the day to give you work, ensuring you share in their misery into the wee hours.

The experience looks good on paper but being staffed on mega-engagements doing very specific  tasks leaves you with just a vague understanding of how specific software /work papers work, without any big picture context. You won't learn much unless you commit years of your life to the job, and doing so is social and familial suicide. You will find that after leaving you will have learned almost nothing useful.

My seniors were socially incompetent, cliquey, terrible at teaching and generally unhelpful - with a couple exceptions. They did not welcome new staff and were condescending and rude.

The healthcare benefits are terrible, especially if you have dependents. My wife and son qualified for state subsidized care, because UHC's coverage was so awful.

The pay is low. You can easily make just as much in an entry level staff accountant or internal auditor role at a private company. 

The flexibility promised by the recruiters and partners is a lie. Simply do not believe any of it. Their ""flexibility"" = being available via laptop 24/7 with no ability to get away from work."

This goes a long way in any client engagement. As a large firm, PwC also has a lot of resources at its disposal which is useful. You work with reasonably intelligent and hard working people, which always makes it easier.

PwC also has some senior leadership who are active in the day-to-day activities of engagements, which is good when they make firm-wide decisions that impact us.","Unlike most consulting firms, PwC does not have an up-or-out structure, which results in a lot of incompetent people who are perfectly happy to stay where they are at. This also means that there is no clear cut path to making Partner should you choose, and a lot more chaff than wheat.

Furthermore, while PwC pays well, their benefits (especially health and retirement plans) are pretty dismal. It is so poor that I am on my wife's healthcare plan as her spouse, which offers me more than PwC's own plan.

As a large firm with audit and tax divisions, PwC also comes with a lot of regulatory and other overhead, which impacts the amount of time you can spend on your actual engagements. Unlike the consulting divisions of other, similar companies (e.g. Deloitte), PwC's consulting analytics are all run by the engagement teams (e.g. expense reports, engagement margins etc). So, this adds additional overhead to already overworked teams."

PwC has gone through it's own share of growing pains and has spun off and then reinvested in a variety of businesses over the years and now that the non-compete with IBM has expired their Advisory practice is fully able to serve clients the way that they want to. This is an extremely exciting time to be a part of this business because the PwC reputation is extremely valuable globally and most of the clients are large multi-nationals. There is a heavy commitment to PwC People and while you work around the clock like a dog, there is a shared respect and support. Similar to living in New York, you never know how supportive your neighbors are until there is a crisis but when there is, the firm stands behind you. 

Strong commitment to community service.","It is by no means perfect, it is often described as Investment Banking hours at accounting wages. There is still a lot the firm needs to do to walk the talk and drink it's own very valubale advice it provides to its clients. There are two types of people at PwC, partners and those waiting to leave. IFS and support roles are simply never as valued as client facing roles and you will not make partner and therefore will never reap the true rewards of your work if you find yourself in that role. IFS people must be satisfied being a servant but never a knight. 

On the client facing side it is very much a deliverable mentality. These are people who are really good at working hard and turning work in on time, but many lack the relationship skills to look past the work product to truly partner with their clients to anticipate their issues and become fully invested in the success of their clients. Subject matter expertise is never a problem, communicating and articulating issues in a way that non-PwC people understand is always underestimated and extremely valuable when done right.

Slow to move - cannon on an ant. Th firm has so many layers of adminstrative beuarocracy that common sense can often take a back seat to policy without purpose. There are great and innovative and creative people who get frustrated and leave because they focus on results and the method is a secondary concern. This is where its history of being an auditor can hinder growth and creativity. Running a business consulting practice which includes tax consulting and transaction services like you do an audit practice simply does not make sense. Again, the firm would not advise its clients to do this but can't seem to get out of its own way.

Can't invest in ANYTHING! Forget your personal portfolio. Working for the firm that audits most of the financial services and fortune 100's means you are precluded from investing in pretty much everything unless you spend all of your free time working through independence issues."

It's growing quickly, much of it by acquisition and the strategy seems to change frequently.  The work is hard and the hours unpredictable.  It can be quite easy between projects but then there is the pressure that you're not ""chargeable"".  You don't want to be in that position for very long or you'll have a target on your head.  The co-workers are top notch and you learn a lot from each other.  Benefits are good.  You're treated like a professional and expected to act like one.  The firm is very concerned with its reputation and looks at you as an extension of their brand.  Many merit-based opportunities for promotion.","While there are many opportunities for professional growth, you don't really have much control over where.  It really depends on the projects you're on and frankly, PwC doesn't exactly do the sexiest types of consulting work.  Much of their focus is improving operations, getting companies out of a crisis or some sort of reporting improvements.  There are often mixed signals between the firm leadership's position on things and how partners actually execute it.  That's not to say most partners aren't working just as hard as the staff, it's just that they have to make clients happy, make staff happy and make the firm lots of money and those three things are pretty hard to reconcile."

Overtime is not paid and salaries are low compared to other offices in neighbouring countries. Annual bonus (for associates) (is so low that, it) is a joke.
Senior Management in PWC is incompetent and very unreasonable when it comes to performance reviews and promotions. As the turnover is high, bright employees leave for better opportunities, leaving behind unreasonable and incompetent management.

Partners are powerhouse - if your are not in their good books then either you dont exist or your life in pwc is short lived - a general trend in these companies is that people either stay 10-15 years or 2 years (first year default rating second year bad rating)
2. Big fours dont have bench - so you are supposed to work on 2 projects simultaneously with 100 % billing in each - minimum because you should be suprised to see people working on 5 projects at the same time - and I dont mean engagement - I mean full fledged development testing work

Additionally the more junior you are the less fair your pay will be; partially this is offset by robust amounts of vacation you will receive. Do not expect a good bonus; it can happen but the bonus mentality in Big Four firms barely rewards the younger staff in proportion to the effort they contribute.

We observed that the consultants tell the clients the best practice without a deep industry experience, but for their telling/advising the best practice, the IFS (internal firm services) does not follow this.  So, we learned that to say the best practice to clients or prospects is easy, but they cannot demonstrate it by themselves.  Good learning opportunity"

I would describe the culture within the practice at best as ""toxic"". Typically, the more tenured individuals within the practice are the most difficult and least enjoyable to work with; Partners and Directors have little interest in your development or interests (e.g. transferring to a different line of service) and are often rude.  At times, this particular practice felt like a sorority where gossip rather than performance prevailed. 

Unless you are working on a marquee client or for a well respected Manager / Director, it is not uncommon for you to get lost in the fold and receive mediocre ratings thru the duration of your employment. Finally, as associates, the bulk of the work you will be performing is Sarbanes Oxley Compliance testing, which is essentially a gigantic compliance exercise that adds little no value.

Poor Leadership which creates a poor culture

Performance Appraisal Process is subjective - you can go the whole year, get great feedback forms, then get a bad overall review.  

Cut Throat - performance system pits peers against one another.  Have a culture where everyone is out for themselves.  They preach teamwork but since the performance system compares you to your peers people are less likely to share knowledge and truly work as a team. 

Politics - if you form alliances and kiss up, you can move up.  Every decision is rooted in some politics - they don't choose the path that is most benefical, they choose the one that is most popular for their personal career advancement.

Lack of advancement opportunity - they tell you to take control of your career and even if you get great ratings, promotions are hard to come by (unless you join as an associate or senior associate) 

Leadership is arrogant and treats staff like slaves.  They preach worklife/balance but if you go on vacation and they need you, your expected to work. Good managers would ensure you had a backup so you can enjoy your vacation - it's a benefit after all.  

PwC  = People Working Constantly

Internal processes - it is impossible to get anything done. So much red tape even for the simplest of requests.  The left hand does not know what the right hand is doing.

A TON of offshoring - if you take an offer there be prepared to be let go in the near future.  They are offshoring in every department and line of service - even parts of the audit practice (although I have not heard of a single partner that had his job sent overseas)

Most of the management is poor but it depends on who your boss is.  I had 7 bosses during my tenure and I can honestly say I only had 2 good ones - and they both quit."

This is a fast paced environment and there are a large number of opportunities for someone to get involved in a variety of projects. There is also possibility for someone to branch out into other areas of the business and gain exposure in a new skill.,One of the biggest down sides of working here is the lack of respect for personal work life balance. The high pressure of deadline driven business does not allow for a possibility to be flexible with your own time. As mentioned above there is lots of possibility to grow and develop but it definitely comes at a price of sacrificing personal time and work life balance. The compensation for time spent on clients is also not equivalent to the amount of hours dedicated to the firm and the sacrifices that are made for the Company. The pressure senior management puts on its staff is not always appreciated but rather demanded.

Dumb people in your social circle will think you work for an investment bank","Within their consulting division, they portray their projects as super important, smart, and strategic.  The reality is that those projects are in the minority.  The firm's bread and butter is in audit and tax.  The majority of the projects are large, terribly boring 'asset management' type activities no one wants to do.  You might get on a few good projects here and there, but for the most part, you won't like a majority of the projects.  PwC would rather take a boring 'dumb' project over a 'smart strategic' one 9 times out of 10.  Less risk and looks better in the partner's profolio.

PwC is great if you're a straight up accountant who loves long hours but doesn't necessary need to think too hard.  If you're more specialized, you don't have much of a future.  The work skews to the accounts, so they have more resources (entry level college grads), they win more work, and they advance up the pyramid scheme faster than consultants.

Also, PwC is highly siloed.  Transfering to another line of work within the firm will literally take years.  They will say 'oh you can do whatever you want.'  You can't.  If you're profitable, partners won't let you leave without long notice.  Any sane person would just go to another company and take you 15% raise."

The same people that implemented the ""inefficient"" IT organization structure from the last time they had a massive layoff from 2010 are still in place and all the worker bees paid the price for it. 

I agree that the business model of third party matrix model was an absolute ridiculousness...it was so inefficient! It required a lot of red tape on ""approvals"" and overtime just to make it work.  However, don't blame the worker bees, including the managers that tried managing that, blame the ""leadership"" that came up with that, who are by the way are still there!

They claimed that they've tried matching resources in roles, whoever ""they"" are because our direct supervisors were not even consulted when they were matching roles.  They've claimed that they've merged roles, but it was clear that it was bottom-line cutting after realizing who were let go.  They got rid of people that were with the firm for a long period of time, earned a lot and/or manager/senior manager/director levels.  Some who were even almost near retirement!  If you look at the career site, you'll find roles that they could have easily matched with more than a handful of people that they got rid of.

Not exactly sure how this company got the ""100 Best Company to work for"" when in reality they failed to take care of their employees.  They could have tried harder in taking care of the very people that worked and served for 10-25+ yrs! They could have given them the option to take on a lower level or looked at their overall experiences and offered education in topics, e.g. DevOps, Agile, etc.  Instead, they've chosen to let go nearly 400 people from Finance, Marketing & Sales, HR and IT.

If you are looking to work here, plan on getting it in your mind that this is NOT the company to grow roots.  Learn whatever there is to learn and move on to other companies that actually care."

We have strategy consulting, agency capabilities, dev resources, designers, deployment capabilities globally, and so on. There is really not much that PwC doesn't do. So there is opportunity to be had in this environment if you have some idea as to what you want to do and are able to network into the teams that do this type of work. 

You may not win on every project but you are able to get a pretty good batting average and then over time build up the relationship capital to be able to get where you want to go. There is a lot of opportunity for career pivots within the firm so before leaving to get your MBA, I always recommend that people first use the firm as a testing ground to see if they like the proposed area and then build a nice story for your application by demonstrating how you are already starting to move your career in this direction.

We continue to add in new capabilities continuously and there is great opportunity to actually start doing work that in industry you probably wouldn't be given the chance to do because you didn't have the experience yet. I firmly believe that PwC offers a great development opportunity for folks who aren't quite sure ""what they want to be when they grow up"" as you can continue to test careers without committing while gaining great experience along the way.","PwC does it ALL. There is a downside to this as well. We are amazingly large now and figuring out who does exactly what you are interested in doing is kind of like the six degrees of separation game with Kevin Bacon. There is a lot of organizational inefficiency to get to where you want to go, and this includes the client delivery side as well. You could be working on an engagement struggling along and then realize some team three doors down is working on the same exact project for another client. You network not just because it's the culture but also because it is a survival skill. 

The net result is that it takes a while to get the relationship capital and organizational understanding together to really know what the opportunities are and then at that point we tend to have lost folks because they feel like they are a ship afloat at sea without a paddle. You really need to work to find the superconnectors to minimize the degrees of separation to enable you to really take charge of your career."

The Chicago office is large, but since i spend most of my time out on audits, I don't spend much time there. I feel like I am surrounded by an educated and qualified staff. The work week is manageable and the vacation time is adequate even in the first few years of employment. I am overall glad that I accepted a position with PWC. The years that I will spend with this company will open the doors to many other firms and corporate work in the future.","Work Place Climate
One of the biggest downsides of working out of Chicago office is that there is a very cutthroat attitude among many of the associates. As with any business that operates under a partnership, rivalries arrise. The partners tend to gravitate towards their own circles and create a work climate that can be intimidating at times. 

Audit Audit Audit
My first couple of years were spent on audits which is not exactly the most titilating work. I would reccomend that you know exactly what type of accounting you would like to get into to before you accept a job with a large accounting firm."
