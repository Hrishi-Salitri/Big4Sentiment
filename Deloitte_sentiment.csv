Deloitte University shows how Deloitte is putting its money where its mouth is in developing its people. Once I attended DU, I knew I had a company that was really trying to change the game in consulting.

There is a common sense that Deloitte Consulting is in the upswing and is clearly taking away work from all other consultancies whether they be strategy firms, digital agencies, or major platform implementers. Deloitte is also attracted people away from these other firms which speaks volumes to how people are perceiving Deloitte.","Deloitte's roots are in audit and tax. Even though the majority of our revenue comes from consulting only, our culture and perception is seen as an audit and tax firm. Deloitte Consulting's leadership talks about innovation and is trying to do things differently but at the end of the day there is this engrained corporate culture of making slides for execs that are hard to read and 99% of them never see the light of day at the end of a project. If you look at how a startup or tech company operates, they do things. They follow agile principles and realize that a public product is better than extensive documentation. This is not the approach Deloitte takes."

2. Highly social organisation with an unusually high concentration of very strong, generalists, especially at the more junior levels. You can develop relationships with hundreds of people that will go on to operate all aspects of Ireland Inc. over the next 10 years.

3. Decent (but pretty limited) exit opps. For S&O, most consultants move into Sales or Customer Success at a tech company. For Tech/Digital, most consultants go into analytics or engineering elsewhere. If you stick around long enough to become a Manager (5-6 years) you have significantly more options available.","1. Performance appraisal, bonuses, and promotions are based on management's opinion of you which is vulnerable to manipulation, bad actors, and incompetence.  

2. Management do not receive training in people management so ability varies wildly. Additionally, performance appraisal is 100% based on your superiors' opinions, so weak people managers routinely blame their shortcomings on external factors and get away with it.

3. Majority of staff are effectively ""leased out"" to a bank for several years, gaining very little useful experience, no development of commercial acumen, and earn significantly less than the bank would have paid them as an employee.

4. Salaries are *significantly* below standard. I've heard of Consultants/SCs doubling their salary after leaving. Even with a top performance rating (0-1% of staff per year) the bonuses are insultingly low.

5. A strong culture of dishonesty, ""spinning"", salesmanship, and saying one thing while doing another. Very little domain knowledge from senior staff. Zero rigour or planning applied by staff below Director level.

6. Firm rewards action for the sake of action. Heavy bias to moving fast and attacking problems with the first thing that comes to mind, rather than trying to find the right solution before acting.

7. No analytical or quantitative acumen in Consulting, with the exception of Analytics

8. The firm leans very heavily on the reputations of the US and UK firms. ""Strategy and Operations"" in Ireland is really ""Sales and Project Management."" Most staff in this division could make significantly more money doing the same job elsewhere with an honest job title.

9. Culture is viewed as marketing nonsense and is poorly conceived. For example: ""an unwavering commitment to each other"" is a deeply inappropriate value for a professional services firm. If I make a mistake in a regulated business I need to know my colleagues will hold me to account, not help me bury the body."

* Vacation time is great. And you're able to use all of it, in the Portland office anyways. 
* Hours during the summer are good. Not too busy. 
* Portland office is a good size (big yet small) so you get to know most everyone
* Client base is diverse","* You definitely feel like a resource/body to be used by those above you sometimes 
* Management is not interested in creating a work environment for people to stay long term. Staying beyond 1-4 years is crazy even for someone who loves auditing and has great clients and support systems. It takes a super ambitious person who is willing to put up with a lot of downsides to stick it out and management is not interested in improving any of those downsides. From talking with my friends at other firms, this is pretty consistent across public accounting in general. 
* Pay is low and you can leave at almost every level for much higher pay for lower hours. Deloitte was the lowest paying of the larger firms in my city and raises/bonuses were poor. 
* Work-life balance during a big chunk of the year is awful
* Audit Quality and Audit efficiency are conflicting goals. So you often end up in no-win situations where there is really nothing you can do to make your partner/manager happy. 
* People eat time all of the time. Managers/Partners know but don't really care and reduce budgets every year and then hold staff to those budgets. 
* Office politics
* It feels like a pretty thankless job"

Although I’ve had previous work experience prior to joining the firm, this is my first opportunity to really become a jack of all trades. It’s impressive how many new skill sets they support in the form of DU training, webinars, classes, project opportunities, and/or specialized trainings (i.e., for newcomers or military veterans). All in all, it’s a wonderful firm to learn and develop in whichever general field you’d like, in whatever account(s) of interest, or area of practice you’re already skilled in or want to grow. Deloitte has a global reach and the resources to support almost anything you want to do.","The nature of consulting often seems like one’s knowledge is a mile wide, but only an inch deep. Not that it’s impossible to become a SME, but until years and years of experience and self-branding, it’s difficult to get projects lined up that truly allow continuity and deep growth in a particular area of interest. There’s just a lot of turn over with projects and it can be frustrating to always feel behind the learning curve with constant “newness”. To be clear, this is also truly amazing to be constantly learning brand new skills, processes, methodologies, etc, however, it’s tough when you know where you want to grow/develop, but it gets put on hold because that project/client/ role may not be available when you are. I often want more time to be stable in a role and become an expert in my field of interest. Unfortunately, I’ve learned that to gain this expertise and to ensure project opportunities in the Deloitte account I’m interested in, I will have to leave the firm to gain that knowledge and then come back eventually. 

Work/life balance can be a struggle sometimes.

3. Those holding positions above Assistant Managers often refuse to even talk to low-leveled staff and this often creates a lag between reviewing work and work done. This also causes new staff to be demotivated and often under perform.

One of the great strengths of the firm is the diverse skill sets and perspectives, and although there are more formal reporting lines and ""proper"" channels for working across disciplines, but informal networking often is the real way that work gets done.  This may serve as an advantage once you are able to develop those networks (and a better understanding of what other services and skills are available within Deloitte), but it can be frustrating if you urgently need to identify a particular skill set outside of your network."

We have the freedom to get off on time without the added pressure of needing to stay because your bosses are staying late. Most often than not the partners (if not your immediate boss) will be ushering you out the door as the Bell tolls for end of day (this bell thing is totally Japanese it rings twice a day morning to start, evening for end of day).

As the down turn of the market suggest lack of ""quality work"" the work for consulting firms are limited. There is really no ""real work"" to be done as the company itself is struggling to get work with competition from PWC, KPMG, and E&Y. Our division in particular is also fighting to grab jobs pitting against internal departments. Overall, most of the time is spent idling by on the company issued laptops using our free time for studies (such as CPA, CFA, GMAT). The freedom to use time on your own is abundant and is greatly geared towards married women who want to earn extra income, struggling artists, or people who need a relaxing environment to suppor themselves before commiting to a graduate degree (although the pay is significantly small and lacking time is in excess).

Job Security is impecable, as with most Japanese firms firing employees are frowned upon. It reflects badly upon the managers if an employee quit or are fired. No one is fired therefore, even if a perosn is caught sleeping on the side no downsides. Overall if you want job security of NEVER getting fired or need a 9-5 job to support your artistic or struggling main career or perhaps a house wife wanting to come back to the work force it is a very inviting place. They are even willing to take back employees who once quit more so than outsiders.","One will be eternally bored if you are use to working for your pay. The concept of work is used excessively and very loosely. No one seems to mind that new hires come in every month as the division is putting out losses. The no stress and no work environment may come to some as an upside, but for over achieving individuals who would like recognition for their work is lacking. Recognition is only given to those on higher levels (much like Japanese corporations) and not necessarily to the individual who achieved the load.

No set career path. As with in most Japanese corporations, there is no ""Set"" career path for anyone. You are brought on as a generalist which is a good idea for developed groups, but not for a company who prides itself on specialist professionals. Without any direction junior personnel is bounced to and from numerous ares without much of a career in any one specific field. Which in return makes them an unfit candidate for jobs which require specialists with individual professional traits required for an Audit/Accounting firm. For individuals at a Junior Level this company is highly advised aginst unless you are content with doing multiple tasks that may not lead to a specialist area, and nothing to add to your CV."

To truly thrive you need to be a go getter, dedicated to your craft. You need think, read, and learn about your craft not just for the 8 hours you are at work. If you are a designer you need to see the world from that perspective all the time. If you are a tester you need to have that curious mind all the time. You need to do what you do because you love what you do, not simply for the paycheck every two weeks.

From a professional development stand point you can go anywhere you want in DD. While you are expected to excel at your current discipline, once you’ve shown that ability you are free to soak up any knowledge you desire. I have seen testers become Project Managers and Developers, Developers become Project Managers and Engagement Managers, and many other discipline changes. 

Senior Leadership’s ability to empower their people and give them the tools to make great works can sometimes be seen as lack of leadership; this is far from the truth. In a non-micromanaged environment it’s the motivated and best of the best that are going to thrive; why would you want to work next to anyone else?","Going from a 150 person company to ~200k comes with serious growing pains.

I was lucky to find a steady long term project to work on.","Performance awards, Year end ratings, project ratings, all depend heavily on the projects you are staffed on. You may have to travel a lot. If you cannot get staffed on a project life can get very hard you'll have to compromise on the project you join. Salary is good out of college, but after a few years you might find you are being underpaid, and the only way to get a raise is to leave the company."

And make no mistake - the senior leadership (not the Senior Managers or your regular engagement Principals, but those who actually make hiring decisions) will have absolutely zero qualms about ""making the difficult decision to separate"" at literally an hour's notice. This is an up or out mentality, and that is perfectly fine, but this is probably the only place I've ever worked that has such little respect for its employees, once it sucks all juices out of them. 

That being said, I've met some of the most amazing colleagues here - people who have truly become my friends and mentors. These are the relationships I will take with me for years to come. 

So take this job offer with a grain of salt. (Also, they will tell you that you're part of just 1% of the applicants who get accepted. This is a lie. Don't drink the Cool-Aid.) Use this company to build your resume - you truly WILL grow professionally and personally, that is a fact. But you will work to the bone for it - crazy hours; always on call (don't believe the Flexibility and Predictability hype); the super-competitive people who will throw you under the buss whenever it may suit them. Deloitte is a shark tank - no more, no less. So take it as such, and make the best of it. Then, after 2-3 years, get out, and join the living in a smaller consulting firm, or elsewhere.","- Cut-throat culture
- Counselors are often inept and downright damaging to your career
- No accountability for leadership
- Salary decisions have zero visibility
- If you have a clearance, you are pigeon-holed into certain jobs
- Ratings are extremely subjective. Because most people in the federal sector work for the same client for at least a year, their ratings are usually done by the same person - which can be an awful idea, since it's extremely subjective and defeats the entire purpose of ongoing performance conversations (By the way, ratings are NOT shared with the employee throughout the year!

- Generally collegial coworkers, especially at the more junior levels
- Interesting project work that takes you across different business problems and industries
- Strong management team that is steering the company is the right direction (from a strategic point of view); good job security
- Points / airline miles from travel and dining out
- Expense accounts are generally lenient (but depend on the client / project)
- Good health benefits
- Pension plan that vests after three years","- Unrelenting demands. Asking for free time to yourself is generally frowned upon. Everyone constantly feels like they need to show how hard they're working
- Uncompetitive pay at the Manager level (other consulting firms generally pay much more at this level), especially in light of the work demands
- ""Nights / weekends firm activities"": one is encouraged to sign up for additional ""nights / weekend"" work to show their dedication to the firm; these contributions are measured and evaluated at year-end
- Generally, travel from Monday morning through Thursday night; travel time isn't considered ""work time"", so travel happens during very early mornings and into the evening.  Only time to see family / friends is Friday evening through Sunday evening
- A lot of apathy amongst employees, especially at the mid-levels; publically, everyone chants ""rah rah!"" but privately, a lot of people aren't very invested in the firm 
- Very limited international work; most work is domestic US
- Terrible 401(k) match, something like 25% to the dollar"

2. Performance review process is relatively flawed in audit. Too much power is given to the manager in team which makes the environment prone to bully and politics. 
3. There is no culture of supporting diversity though the company claims that they are all about it. There is clearly favourism toward the native. For example, it is noticable through the last 5 years that most of the international trainees either got fired or got their probation extended after the first 6 months. It might be understandable if some unfortunately doesnt perform so well but it's questionable that all internationals got the same problems about communication and attention to details as Hr at Deloitte claims to.

- Long hours, especially in M&A. Generally more laid back in Tech Strategy and GPS.
- Can be very political. It's pretty much up to you to network onto projects, so it can be hard for Analysts to get onto projects because they don't have a network built up (however, Deloitte recognizes this and doesn't stress utilization within first year at the firm)
- Performance reviews are very subjective (make sure your Manager likes you)
- Part of your performance review is based on internal firm initiatives. Adds to your hours (advice: find a fun initiative in an area you're passionate about)"

Networking opportunities.","If you have been a consulting professional with ten or fifteen years of experience already, do not expect Deloitte to recognize that and hire you on your proper level.  They will put you at the bottom rung of their ladder and you then discover that the people who 'manage' you are grossly inexperienced in people-management.  You then discover that you are being used simply as a lowly temp as if you are in temporary staffing firm where you are literally railroaded into 'projects' you never interviewed for.  Unconscionable !! 

During the interview process going in you do not know that 'Managers' means people with only 5 years experience; and that 'Director' are actually people on your level - and there is no way to catch up to that level when you are placed on a relative low-level position.  

Long-term projects are closely guarded and impossible to find; resource managers are simply not invested in trying to get you the right project to your skills; 'networking' puts you in a position of almost begging and people know that you have a 'handicap' by being new to Deloitte and thereby try to just use you as a warm body.  

It is also a well known fact in the consulting community by now that Deloitte ""over-hired"" last fall without assigning new hires a project, causing many talented people to sit on the bench and then get terminated in the spring.  Several of the earlier reviews do resonate with my experience as well, such as 'politically charged' environments, and 'putting a warm body to a project', and also senior managers not caring enough in the development and growth of people under the 'Manager' position.  

It was absolutely a no-win situation for a seasoned, highly experienced consultant - there should be a warning or a disclaimer somewhere in their hiring process that makes it clear:  ""Our ideal candidates are under 25"".  It is the unspoken rule of their game."

Management blindly favors couple of old employees and has awarded them back to back promotions and also has given them free rein to harrass and insult people. These Managers/ Senior Managers are very vocal in using staffing and appraisals as tools to intimidate people and humiliate their unfavored people very openly. This has also led to panic attacks and nervous breakdowns in many juniors. When some of the employees escalated issue to management, rather than taking any action against them, they were actually rewarded through promotions and good ratings every year. The people who filed complaints always end-up resigning because after filing complaints their life become even more miserable. 
Management is even allowing engaged /married couples to work in the same department (in violation of global policy), where they can affect each others and their juniors' appraisals/promotions very visibly.  In the historical meetings, the married/engaged couples had been advocating each others performances very vocally, which affected their ratings/ promotions and secondments very positively.  
Thus, its a really bad place for people who want to grow through performance alone. Humiliating juniors is a way of life here, which is rewarded by management."

However as you progress through your career you'll find yourself being overqualified for many positions (expecially manager level and above). Deloitte offers comparable benefits to those seeking a stable job. Depending on your office, you'll meet all kinds of people, most of them enjoyable. Trainings and the big 4 name gives you a pretty good career boost overall (that is if you're aiming for a future in the Accounting industry). Pretty good airline miles and hotel points I must add if you're traveling a lot. d","Not enough focus to entry-level folks. Deloitte brands its image as being people centric but in reality it's all about the bottom line: keeping in line with partner's profits. When layoffs come, partners will care less about how much you've spend working and contributing to the firm and start switching into office politics to determine whether you should stay or not. If you're looking for achievement and career growth, you'll find yourself ending up in a pretty narrow corridor (as  you can see from their retention rate). I'd say, get a couple of years down your belt and get out ASAP."

Great for variety or first career position i.e. new graduate.,"No direct contact or rapport building with internal supports like IT or HR which makes for a difficult transition.  Hard switch for career professionals because there is no defined roles. Roles will change depending on the resoures needed for client work.  Even if you're not a Business Analyst, you just might be for any given project. Clients and deadlines are often the priority over the employee and the is no such thing as reporting overtime. Demand for work can be very low at times and there is no real consistency unless you are on a long term assignment.  There isn't any interest in ensuring you are on a project. You will need to do your own networking to get assignments. Most teams that have worked together continue using the same people. Be very careful to know which location you will work for and if the team has had successful projects in the past (especially for design or technology groups).

Working for a smaller accounting firm might not bring the same opportunities, such as contacts with the finance and business world.  Such a large office meant that there were definitely opportunites to move within the same company; most people only think of Deloitte as an accounting firm, but they also have a large finance and consulting wing.  Deloitte also paid pretty well for the base salary as compared to some smaller firms.  The benefits were pretty good, and we got over three weeks of paid vacaction a year.  There were lots of layoffs this year, but Deloitte, to their credit, tried really hard to help us move to different parts of the firm before ultimately letting some of us go.","If you are working on the business side, as opposed to accounting, you'll be working with the investment banks a lot.  You might be disgruntled knowing that you are doing a lot of the same work as your counterparts at the bank, yet making significantly less than them.  Even in the good years, your bonus will be almost laughable - and in the bad years, as this year, don't hold your breath expecting a bonus.  Also, as an accounting firm, your hours are at the whim of the client - you managers may be able to reason with the clients, but don't expect that to affect your hours that much.  You can't scoff at working well past midnight or on the weekends - and then other times you may have nothing to do for long, boring stretches of time."

These are great for teaching financial skills, but I couldn't recommend it as a long-term career option - hence why I moved to a specialised area within Corporate Finance.

It's also useful to have a Big 4 name on your CV rather than a smaller practice. The scope for larger, more complex and more interesting projects is therefore bigger at Deloitte than much of the competition.","At the bottom it can be very dull with relatively low pay, but this is compensated for via the ACA qualification which makes you very employable. As you progress, you get more control over work hours and which projects you work on, but I've been lucky and many people can end up with tough hours and repetitive work.

There's also a huge amount of bureaucracy, as you'd expect in a large organisation. This can be a real bore and take up large amounts of time. Throughout much of the firm you're also expected to put your life on hold for work, but this largely depends on how good your managers/Partners are and how much they care - there's a lot of variety but most expect hard work and work life to be the absolute priority."

First of all, the working environment is professional, and so they expect you to work hard. There are not room for slackers or coasters. Their compensation is however reflective of their expectations. Not only are you given the days to take a break and unplug, but also numerous benefits. Furthermore, starting off your career at a place like Deloitte will really help in the future to come as you pick up on things and learn not only about the different businesses, but also what it means to being someone with good work ethics.","There might be people who might think that there is not work life balance at a big firm like Deloitte. And there is half truth in the statement that during busy season, you are expected to work hard and maybe past the 5 o'clock time. But when busy season is over, you are given a lot of paid time off to really get the rest you earned through your hard work. So it really depends on your personality. Do you like to work hard and play hard? Or do you prefer to just put in your 8 hours of work everyday? If you are someone who prefers the latter, the ""work life balance"" may be a con. But you have to understand that it is the nature of the business; A busy season and not a busy season."

Example: Avg employee works 9hrs a day with 1 hr as his breaks. In deloitte, work is assigned based on hours and its expected to finish it asap. If you complete 8 hr of work then they will assign another set work to you. In short hard worker needs to work really hard. Avg time a employee spends in deloitte is 11hrs working (without breaks).

Counter effect is that you will left feeling unaccomplished and will be in a depressed state. Spend 2 years in deloitte and i garantee you will be scared to attend another interview feeling like you learned nothing. By the way most the tech they use is legacy so very little chance to develop skills."

Great people to work with that have strong work ethic, commitment to quality.
Autonomous and supportive of new business opportunities.
Good social opportunities to make new friends especially for juniors.","When you get past the gloss there is little content supporting client facing operations, delivery of challenging work is due to skills of employees gained outside of deloitte. Juniors develop useful technical skills purely due to mentoring by senior staff on the job.
Partners promote those like them, very rare to have a technically capable partner, most are squeezers who take advantage of staff or management by spreadsheet types. Middle management at the partner level has a sleazy kind of feel. Those aspiring to be partner as well. 
No time allocated to take advantage of elearning opportunities..
So many meetings, performance management commitments and non billable ""stuff"" allocated by partners that you end up catching up on billable work and proposals outside of working hours.
HR is ineffective despite massive performance management culture, personnel that should have been performance managed out due to personality problems, abusive attitudes to counselees were not. Support for those that crack up due to the strain non existent, you are advised to call an outsourced employee assistance program. 
Employees chewed up and spat out. They bring in useful skills that atrophy due to lack of training opportunities and time to self educate, eventually they are no longer relevant technically. 
Expected to be married to the job, cult like culture. Very difficult to switch off due to the pressure of massive unrealistic expectations.work from home opportunities just brings the stress into the home and extend the working day into the night. If you don't have a mega supportive spouse don't think about working in a senior capacity there it's a recipe for divorce."

Almost automatic promotion / career progression in early years when joining as a graduate. Huge graduate intake means it is relatively easy / uncompetitive to get in.

Good client base and some varied and interesting work further down the line.","Conservative firm with the stereotypical accountant image and culture (boring, poor social skills) tending to pervade all service lines to some extent. It varies from place to place but most people who work here are conformist and not particulalry interesting, sociable or cultured. ""Diversity"" means a few candidates from BME backgrounds rather than any true variety of people.

Many of the graduate intake are tiresome individuals who did not give sufficient thought to their career choices until their final year of university. Unqualified for proper careers and not quite good enough for banking they then select a career at a Big 4 firm as Mummy and Daddy have heard of them, it cuts enough mustard with their peers, the graduate marketing materials were reasonably slick and it just seems that bit sexier than that grad scheme at whatever-it-was blue chip.

Having secured the job they really think they are doing something prestigious and worthwhile rather than entering on the least competitive graduate scheme going and destined for several years of tedium.

Real disillusion inevitably sets in a bit later when they realise what audit actually involves and that being an accountant is profoundly uninteresting to any body they might meet at parties.

At this point they tend to leave and find more interesting jobs and get some of their life back, hopefully before it is too late. This accounts for the huge turnover / attrition.

There is little point in staying too long as the reward scheme is purely geared towards a ""jam tomorrow"" possibility of becoming a partner (a possibility that is fairly limited, for most). There is no such thing as any equitable share of the profits on the way and your charge-out rate will be entirely decoupled from the cost to the firm of employing you. Rather it is designed to gouge from clients as possible and maintain the bloated remuneration of the partners."

Most make themselves available and are easy to talk to; most are not overly arrogant 
-Excellent training, both virtual and via Deloitte University in Dallas
-Smart, talented, and personable/friendly co-workers
-Continuous learning and the opportunity to really enhance your skills
-Lots of well organized networking and social events 
-It's a well respected firm, and makes for a great resume add
-Very good pay and benefits
-It's an excellent place for a recent college grad or young MBA to launch a career","-Unfortunately, the review written on Oct 10, 2012 about experienced hires still holds true today. Deloitte is difficult to assimilate into if you are an experienced hire, particularly one that has spent most of your career on the industry side
-Understand that working for a consulting firm is a lot different than being on the industry side; Deloitte recognizes this and tries to be supportive, but it can be a difficult leap when on a project and trying to do work ""the Deloitte way""; there is little tolerance for views that don't align with the Deloitte way of thinking, particularly from those who have never worked in industry (which are most)
-The focus is more on appeasing the demands / expectations of Deloitte project leaders than it is on doing what's best for the client;  A lot of time is spent creating elaborate / complicated documents that the client will probably never actually use because they're not practical, but those are viewed as high value deliverables by Deloitte leadership 
-Deloitte is more than a job; it is a way of life.  Understand that joining the consulting division means lots of travel, long hours, and a very high level of intensity.  It's ALL Deloitte, ALL the time.  
-Client work is only one part of the equation. Everyone must engage in 'practice development' which is in addition to client work.  So you put in your 45-55 hours a week on client work (sometimes more) and then shift to practice development activities. Practice development is an important differentiator when review time rolls around.  Given the high caliber of co-workers, doing good work is a given. The only way to distinguish yourself is to take on numerous of these 'extra' assignments, which also helps increase your network.  
-Networking is beyond important.  You must get your name out there with people who have influence and can help get you staffed. 
-There are a lot of social events, which are also networking opportunities. Attendance is encouraged. As mentioned above:  it's all Deloitte, all the time.
-This is a young person's game unless you have spent your entire career in consulting and acquired the skillset early on.  Don't underestimate the difficulty of transitioning from industry if you are 35 or older, particularly if you don't have prior consulting experience. It can be a real confidence killer."

Further, there is a conscious effort to help you learn the latest amendments in laws or the best of the techniques to audit.
2. Coming from a mid size firm or a small size CA firm- the experience would be really good. Because the processes are so good that you yourself would become more organised while working. It helps you to be a better professional.
3. My team has a good work life balance - i only work Saturdays on extreme cases (say 1 saturday in a month - which is good compared to other big 3).","1. All the above Pros are highly dependent on the team you get. And moving from 1 team to another is a not easily possible when you are at the lowest level in the pyramid - Assistant Manager.

2. They pay the worst compared to the other Big 3.
3. There are no offsites like EY or KPMG. Therefore, a 'fun' element goes out of the window.

They make you jump through hoops to 'earn' a promotion that technically you've been performing for at a minimum 6+ months. You will be pushed to work crazy hours and beyond your mental limits working 6-7 days a week, 12+ hours a day, having anxiety over the onslaught of emails / work over the weekend.

It wasn't until I left that I realized how much it was a problem because the work is so stressful and you need to take the edge off.

Despite being a Software Developer, I liked the emphasis put on skills such as communication, teamwork, networking, and industry knowledge, in addition to technical skills.  This has definitely helped me to grow and stand out in my field. 

Internal initiatives allow employees to explore new career areas outside of client work.  

Benefits are good, and so are the amount of available PTO days.","Work/life balance can be very poor.  While I worked on projects where this wasn't the case, I was working 80+ hours at my last project there.  There were even some weeks where I worked around the clock.  The last straw came when I had a conference call that went from 9pm to 2am in the morning, only to have my manager call me the following morning at 7am to see if I was up working again, despite the late night.  Mind you that I had to be at the client site that same morning.  It was a non-stop cycle.  I can honestly say that since I've left that I make way more money, work way less hours, and I'm able to enjoy other parts of my life now.  

In addition to client work hours, the internal initiatives were forced on all employees, and if you didn't do a lot of them, you would be evaluated harshly at Year-End.  This caused a lot of people to just ""check the box"", particularly with community service activities, where I would hear people constantly say things like they're just ""getting their hours in"".  I'm sorry but I feel like you should have a purpose for doing volunteer work, not just because Deloitte tells you to do it. 

There is a lot of favoritism at the firm as well, more than I've seen at any other job that I've had. I also felt that there was little to no respect for experienced hires.  Which was unfortunate because I found that most people that grew up in the Deloitte culture were very generalized and didn't have the skill set that experienced hires had.  Many of the young analysts were also very rude, arrogant, and disrespectful, and I felt that senior management encouraged this kind of behavior.  

I could seriously go on and on, but this highlights some of my biggest complaints.  If you're one that wants to live life, and not be chained to a job, be very very cautious before deciding to come to Deloitte.  I would also forewarn anyone who has a family (poor work/life, no regard for family duties), or someone who (like myself) is in a very tech-focused field (much of Deloitte's tech consulting firm is ""process"" based - they have very few software development projects)."

The work environment is collaborative where the majority of the staff also work hard.  For those with the right background and a willingness to network, the opportunities are boundless.  The compensation at the lower levels is mediocre at best, especially when considering the hours of work that are demanded.  Compensation improves as you move up, with Partners doing well, especially given their limited skill set and brain power.  Deloitte will improve one's ability to present and sell without any true substance to back it up.  Intestesting place to park yourself for a couple of years.","Quite honestly, the work is not especially stimulating.  What's so interesting about accounting?  The Partners tend to thing of themselves as Gods who's word has to be obeyed by lower level staff.  But, most do not have very impressive resumes: graduates of second/third rate schools, no experience with world class companies outside of the Big 4, closeminded individuals without a true world prospective.  They are lucky to be making what they do.  Much smarter and hard working individuals outside of the Big 4 make far less.  Regulation (audits, tax returns, etc.) give them a good thing.  Most couldn't make it in Investment Banking or Strategy Consulting...not smart enough."

Internally, there has been little integration and it is really a number of partner fiefdoms with varying culture. My partner's little empire was actually better than most, but that's not really saying much.
- Poor senior management: Most partners in Deloitte's India member firm seem to have got there by being part of the old boys network. Limited consulting competencies and even less of actual industry experience. So while many are ""nice"", but most are not ""smart"".  
- Lack of quality work: The obsessive focus on utilization means that any and all projects are bid for and accepted. There is no focus on building Deloitte's market position within industries. Whatever project comes our way, we'll do it. That is the modus operandi
- Poor quality outputs: Compared to my previous consulting firm, Deloitte's deliverable quality is terrible. The rigour in analysis, problem solving, hypotheses generation etc. leaves a lot to be desired
- Cookie cutter approach: On a post merger integration project I was part of, the approach was to look at Deloitte's previous similar work and rehash slides without paying adequate attention to the client's specific needs
- Wide disparity in consultant quality: The abilities at various levels (con, sr. con, mgr, sr. mgr, director) varies significantly even within the level. Have met some really sharp consultants and a good number of awful sr. mgrs and directors.
Deloitte (at least Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India Pvt Ltd) is largely an audit firm with a consulting practice. So everything else is driven from that mentality."

No growth both in terms of technology and personally.

You definitely don't choose your career at Deloitte(USDC) like they advertise.You shall work in what you are put into even if your offer letter says otherwise. 

Differences in outlook and responses between lower middle and upper management. They role play the bad cop good cop routine and does a horrible horrible job at that. So be very careful on how you communicate your grievances.

Less benefits and pay than core. Almost like a cheaper version of core.

Management is horrible. And owing to the fact there are so many Indians, you will experience the same politics you might have faced working in Indian offices.

They don't actually try to retain employees. Their model is to hire freshers at below par market rate (thanks to the challenging job situation currently) and will encourage you to leave so that they won't have to promote you. Then they will get another batch of freshers and the cycle continues. Just like how Indian IT companies work.

Also, the firm has amazing benefits, and I think fair compensation for the junior levels.","There are so many opportunities that you really need to learn how to say no.

I think it'll be good to have Deloitte Consulting on my resume but not sure if the hours and hours of work above and beyond normal workloads was worth it. The final line is that Deloitte Consulting is good for the resume but bad for your relationship at home, with friends, etc. because you are either traveling or you are working at home on the weekends.","In the consulting practice it's a sweatshop and you have to work 60 - 70 hours a week. Constant travel. If you are not a long term employee then you are not in the ""club"" and therefore you are always treated like a new employee and not a long term team member. The firm has a way of treating people unfairly most often those who are new. I was just laid off and I must admit it was a complete surprise as to how it happened, why it happened and the timing. I am considering suing the firm because I believe I was laid off because of my age. I had been with the firm about 18 months."

Deloitte encourages you to use your vacation days and they also participate in community activities like Impact Day which is good.","The hours can be long.  Sometimes while at a client, it's Friday and you're ready to go home, someone will ask you to do something at the end of day which you know will take you several hours to complete.

Once you make management, it's great to have staff with that attitude, but when you're the staff it sucks at times.  

Pay is not the greatest.  You hear people leaving the firm and getting huge pay bumps or there are people outside of the Big 4 in private who are doing the same thing you do but making more and working less hours.

The work environment felt hostile to me; I found managers largely unapproachable and that my peers saw me as competition rather than a teammate.  It was hard for me to find a project that was a good fit for me, most opportunities I was offered fell way outside my area of expertise.  I never once felt appreciated working here.  I got laid off over the phone because it was raining and the guy terminating my contract didn't want to walk across the parking lot in the rain.

I’ve seen multiple instances in which low performing employees were given years (literally years) to improve performance and were supported with coaching and training. I’ve also seen the firm actively work to find a different position for employees where their original position just wasn’t working for them or Deloitte.  

It sounds simple, but so many companies these days dispose of employees without a second thought.  Deloitte recognizes that they hired the individual in the first place because they have talent, and really goes above and beyond to make it work for both sides. This isn’t to say nobody gets fired at Deloitte, but I can guarantee you that due process was given before the axe came down.","=- Too much Administrative red tape at times.

-Quality of work doesn't matter at all - as long as you get an extension to the project
-Doesn't matter if there are qualified people to do it as long as there are bodies to be thrown at the project

MANAGEMENT
-A joke really - both partners are abusive, talk only and do jack. Directors suck up to the partners and sleep in their 'privileged' rooms all day.
-Senior Managers (who do jack most of the time as well) leave to join larger tech companies to continue selling dreams. Just linkedin these jokers (in Singapore) and you will know what I mean
