The relationship with upper management is really good.  You get feedback on a regular basis from many different  managers at different levels.  
The firm has an emphasis on work life balance.  They allow you to be flexible with work schedules as long as you still get your work finished. 
KPMG encourages and allows for rotations to different places around the world.  
KPMG also has many short term travel opportunities that you can encounter when working at all levels of the organization.","Longer work weeks than you will find in ""industry"", but the same as other big 4.
Sometimes you can look back and find that your month was crazy traveling all over the place, but it does not seem bad if you are ok with a changing environment."

2. Lunch allowance.","1. Study package for ACA delivered by BPP is predominantly delivered remotely, the first face to face college time I had was a year into the training programme. Therefore college time does not also involve developing relationships with colleagues, for many trainees this is a large pull for the job.  
2.  Lack of support for study from engagement managers - many instances of not being given the timetabled study time for the ACA.  Often being told you have too much study for exams the manager thinks are easy (in many instances the manager has completed a different qualification, not the ACA, so do not know what the exams entail).  
3. No work/life balance - most weeks from September to April/May have been 60 hours at least, mainly due to a lack of headcount in the department.
4. Lack of variety for trainees - many trainees stay on the same client for 3 years.  Give trainees a rounded experience of different departments and different industries, this may help retention rates."

The firm appears to really (truly) care about delivering quality work to clients.

There are some smart cats there.

Good job security (you need to be a complete idiot to lose your job).  

When you turn your LinkedIn button on, recruiters will smash you with offers offering higher pay and significantly better work-life balance.","Honestly, auditing sucks.  You will spend countless hours with your butt in a chair ticking and tying.  What you studied in college was far more interesting than auditing. 

You will get weird looks for having the gall to take a breather.

You will get treated like a child. Told when you can go to lunch, when you can go home etc...  

You will likely get hit with a soul crushing workload.  Then you will get pulled off of whatever menial task you're working on and told to jump on something else.  Rinse and repeat all day.  

That quality work I mentioned above will come at the expense of your evening and weekend life.

You will drive several hours to count boxes at a warehouse in the middle of nowhere, and be asked to log in that night at the hotel to help out on your current engagement.

You will be asked to sacrifice many weekends; ""Oh just log in from home, that is OK!""  

Do not make plans, you are at the complete mercy of your engagement team.

 During campus recruiting, you will be told you will work ""normal"" hours with the exception of season.  This is a lie.  You have interim, quarterly, and a myriad of other reasons for the team to panic and rack up billable hours. 
This will occur at the drop of a hat too; even when Grandma flew into visit. 

Everything is treated like it is the most important business task in the world.  

Despite all of the warnings you read on the internet, you will drink the koolaid during recruiting and accept the offer."

In one year with KPMG, you learn what it takes maybe 1.5 times the time in another work environment. You generally work with young energetic people, and you get to interact with senior level management at client sites. You also get to move around a lot (i.e. you get to travel and work out of different locations). Ther eis a good amount of time off (6 weeks); the starting salary at KPMG (consistent with the Big 4) is higher than in other places. You also get to work independently. After the work is done, also KPMG parties hard, which is fun (work hard, play harder atmoshopher).","The hours can be terrible, but it completely depends on the client you get placed on. Some peoplework a lot more than others, and there is very little recognition between those people. Sure, there are ratings (exceptional performer, vs standard performer), but aside from that, there is a very simal compensation differentiation. Also, you are managed by people who are one year your senior. You could get lucky to work with people who are good, but there is an equal change to work with your seniors who are terrible managers. And, these people, one year your senior, have the power to make your life at KPMG good or terrible. All of your extra effort or lack thereof is seen by your senior but rarely by the executives by the company, so it doesn't pay to put so much effort. The culture assumes that long hours are normal. Someone makes a budget of how many hours something should take, and you have to explain why you went above/below that budget which you didn't really agree with to begin with. THere is pressure to understate hours. Seniors also send you to discuss/argue points with client executives that you don't understand. And you just end up getting yelled at and hated by the client."

They work hard back home, get a job here and then decide to just cruise. No longer as driven. Kinda weird phenomenon but I guess it's because it's no longer difficult to secure a job here.

The best way to choose which firm you want to work for is to figure out the culture of the offices in the city you are wanting to work in. The Big 4 have tons of networking events you can go to and meet their team so figuring out which firm you like the best shouldn't be too difficult. Remember that you will be around these people for 80+ hours a week during busy season so it helps a lot if you like your co workers, or can at least tolerate them.

Another thing to factor in is their client base in the city you wish to work in. Many clients hire their auditors after they have a few years under their belt, so if one of the Big 4 has clients that are companies you would like to work for then you may want to choose them.

I have no consulting experience so i cant really speak to that, but i do know that D&T was the only firm who didn't sell their practice after SOX which has given them a leg up on the other 3"

Although they have tried to improve their 401(k) contributions, it’s still almost a joke at how little they are willing to match. Also, singles watch out...unless you have children, you can kiss work/life balance away. However, if you’re an accountant thinking about working at KPMG, don’t be mislead...this is standard across ALL public accounting firms. The adage is true — the PEOPLE you work with make the difference and the overtime, work, and benefits are pretty standard across the board."

Firm employees have every opportunity to chart out their career growth paths, and are encouraged along these lines by periodic discussions with their performance managers about where they are, where they want to be, and what they need to get there.  The firm provides great training opportunities both online and instructor led course; and in fact KPMG mandates that employees complete a specified number of CPE hours yearly.  In line with career growth and education opportunities, the firm provides great mobility.  If for whatever reason find that you need to move to another city, or country for that matter, they will work with you to identify a position in that location.  If you wish to try living and working in another country, KPMG regularly offers secondment opportunities that you can apply for.  

The firmâ??s focus on professionalism and integrity is abundantly clear from recruitment and through your career at KPMG.  Salaries seem fair and benefits are\were great.  Work/Life balance did not seem like just talk, the firm makes an effort to not to drive you to the ground.  They make very reasonable accommodations and provide flexible or alternate work schedules.  They also have great community outreach and volunteer groups.","Be prepared to work long hours/days at crunch time.  This can be quite stressful and taxing for some.  Travel can be quite challenging.  Depending on the team/line of business you are in, you could spend 3-4 days a week away from home, back on the weekend and its back on the plane again on Sunday in order to be at the client site Monday morning, bright eyed and bushy tailed.  Itâ??s amazing how all airports, cities and hotels start looking alike.  There have been times when I have woken up in the middle of the night and could not remember what city I was in.  Travel can really be hard on the family.  I know folks whose relationships/marriages have gone up in smoke because of this.  Of course when home for the weekend i.e. Friday evening through Sunday afternoon, you have your â??crackberryâ? mobile device with you in order to respond promptly to client/team requests.

On a parting note, you may be good at what you do, but as you leave the Associate or Senior Associate ranks and join management, be prepared to start selling.  You will be expected to bring in work and the firm sets the dollar amount that you are to hit.  You may be the biggest, baddest investigator/accountant, once you hit management, you are going to have to be a sales person and start focusing on business developement.  I have known good people that have lost their jobs because they do not sell well, but are otherwise great people managers.  

Compensation does get better though.

Also, senior managers are not always entirely truthful.  Be sure to have your BS filter tuned to high when talking with them."

You almost know everybody in your audit department group. Everyone is friendly there and as such there is no negativity with regards to working with your peers.","Working late nights is the norm here. If you are not working beyond 8pm that means you are not working seriously.
One of the major default in their working is that audit staff has IT admin passwords which they use to change time and date to allow audit documentation beyond deadlines. I haven't encountered any such instance but anyone can heavily misuse the password to bring down the entire KPMG network with it. Everyone in the audit from associate/ article trainee to the partner knows about sharing of IT admin password and they don't care

There is NO clean desk policy. They have a policy but just in papers. You can see audit and tax files lying all around office. If one wants to intentionally seek out any information regarding public companies, it is quite easy, just grab any file in the office lying around and 4 out of 10 times you may come across information about a public company. And there are no cameras to see who is looking for the information. If you are worried about being caught by other co-workers then just come to office on a Sunday of late night after 12am.
Apart from potential fraud opportunities, not following the clean desk policy makes the KPMG office seem like a govt. office and just reduces the quality of work environment. You just sometimes don't feel like working there."

So, engagement teams eat their hours all the time to not go over budget but they run the risk of getting laid off due to low utilization. They accept clients that require lots of manual hours of data entry so they push the data entry to the staff rather than sending that work to the India Q center where it belongs so the crop of people moving up don't know anything about tax.  PWC has internal proprietary software that cuts the data entry to a fraction of the time KPMG would spend giving it the staff to do, which frees up the PWC staff to actually learn more important concepts. The quality of training is a joke.  No one in senior management and above really cares about your career, so watch your back.  Being on the client side now and seeing PWC work my employer's account, I can see the difference in training and quality.  I would not recommend choosing KPMG over the other Big 4 firms."

The other professionals working with you are you're greatest resource and are exceptional friends and colleagues.,"Prepare to have no life outside of work. Never in my life could I have ever imagined working this much. You work on weekends, sometimes 7 days a week, often times without charging the time or getting recognized for putting in the effort to meet unreasonable budget and time deadlines that your managers will never commend you on. Prepare for 40-55 hr work weeks during summer and 80-100+ hr work weeks from September-April. 

Your clients will never be pleased to see you, no matter how good you are, and they will in fact make that known to you at all times. Some are often very difficult to work with or get the right information from. 

On top of everything, the salaries they are offering are much lower than the mid tier firms for some unknown reason and when you calculate the number of hours you put in compared to your pay you might be making somewhere near $12/hr while they charge the client $350/hr for your services.

They give you 25 days PTO but implemented 7 days of mandatory PTO, further reducing your paid vacation/sick time to about 18 days. Its not uncommon to get bad performance reviews for taking PTO at times that are not advantageous to the firm. For example, if you book a vacation a year in advance and due to client push back the engagement doesn't finish on time but you leave for vacation, that will negatively be frowned upon no matter how out of your hands the situation may be."

In one year with KPMG, you learn what it takes maybe 1.5 times the time in another work environment. You generally work with young energetic people, and you get to interact with senior level management at client sites. You also get to move around a lot (i.e. you get to travel and work out of different locations). Ther eis a good amount of time off (6 weeks); the starting salary at KPMG (consistent with the Big 4) is higher than in other places. You also get to work independently. After the work is done, also KPMG parties hard, which is fun (work hard, play harder atmoshopher).","The hours can be terrible, but it completely depends on the client you get placed on. Some peoplework a lot more than others, and there is very little recognition between those people. Sure, there are ratings (exceptional performer, vs standard performer), but aside from that, there is a very simal compensation differentiation. Also, you are managed by people who are one year your senior. You could get lucky to work with people who are good, but there is an equal change to work with your seniors who are terrible managers. And, these people, one year your senior, have the power to make your life at KPMG good or terrible. All of your extra effort or lack thereof is seen by your senior but rarely by the executives by the company, so it doesn't pay to put so much effort. The culture assumes that long hours are normal. Someone makes a budget of how many hours something should take, and you have to explain why you went above/below that budget which you didn't really agree with to begin with. THere is pressure to understate hours. Seniors also send you to discuss/argue points with client executives that you don't understand. And you just end up getting yelled at and hated by the client."

You will find whispers of it everywhere- even here on Glassdoor. It was a promotion year for me, and my direct manager refused to meet with me unless I went to his hotel for my mid-year review. He wouldn’t give me feedback any other way, and he had pushed the meeting off for so long I was in danger of not making the deadline for feedback, so I went. Once I’m there, he actively avoids talking about work, instead telling me how much he likes me. He then tries to kiss me. I was shocked. I somehow get out of there. Then 2 weeks later, he kicks me off my project with no warning. The client is shocked. Not only does it disrupt the work, but there is no suitable replacement. My boss blames all of it on me to the Partners. He continues to retaliate against me. I have no idea what to do. I confide that something is wrong to one of the Partners, but I’m advised not to go to HR b/c that will only make things worse. But I realize I have to go HR and report him. HR does nothing. They take his side and never provide me with any details on how they conducted their investigation. They never provide me with a written document confirming the investigation. This was my #MeToo moment. I cried everyday for months, during and after. They promoted him to junior Partner. They fired me. This is a terrible place to work. Upper managers do whatever they want and no one stops them. There are multiple things written about KPMG and their toxic culture. When I met with employment attorneys and told them I worked at KPMG, they all gave indications that they already knew what I was going to say. Because they had heard it before. Because KPMG had done it before. And KPMG has continued to do it. Do not work here. It is not worth it."

While benefits are good, they are coupled with and rather negated by low salaries (considering the time and knowledge commitment required to perform the job) and very long hours. 5 weeks PTO is somewhat negated by the massive overtime commitment. With large jobs the firm is frequently successful in billing for its employees’ overtime and all such billings largely go into the Partners’ pockets.  KPMG very sneakily appeals most effectively to its core demographic, i.e. recent college graduates (typically 26 and under). As part of this core demographic we are treated as the minions of the firm and are drawn in through the firm making use of such techniques as plying us with alcohol and bringing us in as a cohesive ""starting class"" in order that we feel a certain bond with our peers and thus feel guilty about saying a bad word about the firm."

If your team is a strong one great. If you are joining to build up or to turnaround a practice, the metrics are applied inflexibly. (2) Cultural and metrics-caused silos creating disincentives to work with consultants outside your own partner's team. This can effect the quality of the work if the best resources are not located within your partner's work team (3) compliance rules necessitated by the company's audit practice effectively mean you can't consult to about 1/5 of the Fortune 1000 economy that use the company's audit practice and you and your spouse will be continually monitored with respect to what you invest in, where you bank, etc etc. For those starting out, this is not much of an issue. For those experienced hires with a complex investment portfolio, and who have a set of prior business relationships they want to market to, be aware. Culture, metrics, and compliance challenges are typical of other big four firms, but for experienced hires coming from non-big four professional service firms, the adjustment is material. (4) When selling new work the race to apportion ""sales credit"" metrics among the participants is a contact sport. (5) Firm worldwide organizational makeup is a hindrance to winning multi country consulting engagements. Ask your hiring partner to describe the ""worldwide organization"" and how it works together or the percentage of his team's revenue that depends on cross boarder engagements."

You'll be given sections of the balance sheet to investigate and obtain evidence supporting the numbers. Then you'll make photocopies and tie in all of the numbers back to the balance sheet. These numbers have to be referenced on both the balance sheet and evidence and then filed. This process is repeated on every client, and can be boring and repetitive. You'll be doing this for the first three years.
2.)Hours**. One of the arguments for the lower salary than those in investment banking can expect is that you are working fewer hours than someone, in say, M&A. However, it's not always the case. During ""busy season"" (January - April) you can expect to work from 9am to 8pm, and the occasional weekend. If you are booked on continuous year-end audits, you'll work 9am until 7pm or 8pm every night. Each audit has a deadline, and it is essential that it is met to avoid fines and make sure the client stays happy. This means that you will work whatever hours are needed to make that deadline.
3.)Hierarchy**. The organisational structure is very hierarchical and rigid. At the bottom are the first, second and third year associates, then the executives, assistant managers, managers, senior managers and partners. If you are highly regarded it will take you around 14 years to get to partner level. However, out of an intake of many hundred, only a handful will ever get there."

Having the firm's name on your resume is absolutely required by some companies in and outside the industry for employment at higher, more senior levels.  

Management has a very high technical competency.  Promotion is based almost exclusively on that particular factor (note mention of this in the ""Con"" section as well).

The number and level of benefits is high, as is generally common for the industry.","Training on basic applications, such as proprietary software, and industry-standard software used by the firm was essentially non-existent.  Managers generally have little or no interest in training new staff; the general attitude seems to be ""sink or swim.""  

As noted in the ""Pros"" section, management is very technically competent.  Unfortunately, this is virtually the only factor considered or valued.  People skills, training skills, and basic general management skills are, at best, considered irrelevant; at worst, they are looked down upon. Due to the nature of the industry and the personality types which are most suited to the work (especially compliance work), it is quite unusual to have both the necessary technical competence and people skills in the same package.  Criticisms of work performance are frequently presented in hyperbolic terms, and can be startlingly personal in nature:  ""careless"", ""sloppy"", etc., are frequently and casually thrown around even when there are a small number of insignificant errors.   

Accounting firms, especially Big Four firms, are known for a ""churn and burn"" culture:  departures are frequent and tenures are not normally more than a few years.  Due to a steady influx of young (and naive) students, there is very little impetus for change in the work culture.  As an example, KPMG just recently allowed employees to begin wearing jeans on ""casual Friday"", more than a few years behind the curve."

The variety of projects may be hit or a miss depending on the skillset and how well reputed your MD/Partner is. This can be an excellent place to start off a career straight out of school and/or if you have no liability outside of work (family, hobbies etc.)","- Fairly long working hours (70 + hours a week) is a consistency.
- Weekends are almost always tied up with work that cannot be completed through the week. 
-Work-life balance is a lip service. It also depends on who your partner/MD is - some appreciate work life balance more than others.
- There is little transparency in how the promotion process works - it almost always feels that people (MD/Partners) are gaming the system to their benefit, so unless you're cosy with your boss, it wouldn't matter how effective your client delivery and number of hours worked through the year is.
-Compensation at the year end is a one way street - no negotiation
- There is an underlying notion that you must be in a role for 2 years before being considered for a promotion, despite a stellar pre-KPMG resume. Lesson learn't - negotiate your title before you join the firm. 
- Cross functional rotation is almost non-existent unless you pitch for it yourself and your line of management is supportive of it. This is in contrast with how the firm itself touts the flexibility it offers in terms of performance development by allowing folks to develop cross-functional skills.
- Some folks are offered roles they are not suited/qualified for e.g. a 6 year stint in the firm can lead you into a Director role straight out of school, while many others despite more qualified experience and equally good qualifications may languish due to incompetent management/lack of objective recognition."

You can take on responsibility early, engage with very senior people at the client, be involved in big decisions and learn a lot about the marketplace; whether in a specific sub-sector of the financial services industry, or more broadly if you can network your way onto projects for other teams within KPMG. There is a nice mix of career-consultants and people with deep industry experience, so you can learn from both sides. If you like drinking and international travel, you will be well catered for as a consultant at KPMG.","The lack of strategic direction means that you can be working on very different projects from year to year, and month to month. For a while this is a pro, as it lets you try different approaches, learn to apply consulting skills in a variety of contexts, but in the long run, it is a con for me, as it makes career planning difficult. KPMG ultimately will do whatever clients are paying for this particular month: regulation, IT implementation, business strategy, tax reclaims, or a bums-on-seats job where you are no different to a one-man-band contractor.
Where will I be working in 3 months time? As a consultant, you never really know. 5 days a week in Brussels? 4 days a week in Dublin? 11 hour days plus weekend work in London? Or a more relaxing time ""on the bench"", working on whatever random client pitch absolutely must be finished and submitted in the next 2 hours, when nobody can agree on what our opinions, approach or prices are. Some people thrive on this environment, but generally not the ones with kids.
Performance management, mentoring and coaching of junior colleagues gets some support and a bit of lip-service, but ultimately it's sink or swim, from manager grade downwards."

Over and again I read how others are dissatisfied with Big 4 accounting jobs due to the number of hours required and the work/life balance. If you think a work week should be 40 hours and that you should be compensated at a higher rate of pay for 'overtime', you'll find KPMG 'demanding'. The fact is that if you are looking for a 40 hour/week job, join a union and become an employee in a different industry. Better yet, come and work for KPMG and start complaining about the hours - it'll make me look good.

Read a little about successful people and their workloads when they were young. 40 hours/week? Whatever. Personally, I don't blink at a 50-60 hour work week. After all, there are 168 hours in a week. If I work 60, travel another 3 hours to and from work, and sleep 56 hours, that leaves me 49 hours/week for personal time, or 7 hours per day. That's more than enough time for me to have a strong social life.","- Unclear about bonus/raise structure. Management should make an effort to keep employees informed re: expected departmental bonuses and raises.
- While ""career paths"" are fine, dedicated individuals who are carrying the load 'a rank higher' should be duly noted and promoted."

In some cases, it's almost like a fraternity or sorority.  In addition, you are also able to experience the business issues faced across different organizations that help you gain a bigger picture about a specific problem.  Good Resume Builder.  

Also, working at KPMG offers you the flexibility that most industry jobs do not offer.  As a consultant, you are always on the go and reporting to different clients.  This means that you must really learn to manage your time effectively to meet your clients needs and also your personal time.  Given this understanding, management often allow you to work from home when necessary.  In addition, the vacation package is higher than most industry jobs.  

Job Security at Audit Firms are typically good.  Publically traded companies are mandated by the Government to be audited and therefore, there is a steady stream of work to be performed in this industry.","KPMG is operated under a Partnership.  As in all partnership, it appears that it is difficult to control the organization and steer it in one direction as a corporation would be able to.  Each regional office appears to have their own agenda, and the partners themselves do not always appear to be in-sync with the company direction.  It's oftenly appears like an ""every man for themselves"" type atmostphere... espeicially when the business environment is like the way it is these days.  

The pay at KPMG is sub-par compared to industry jobs, especially in the Southwest Region (TX, LA, CO, AR).  While the Oil & Gas sector has exploded, the pay at KPMG for similar type work has not been able to match what industry is paying.  It is not uncommon to hear people leaving KPMG for 20-30% salary increases.   

 Often, the notion of Work Life Balance is false.  It is not uncommon for Staff and Management to work 60 hour work weeks, especially during the year-end audit busy seasons.  Advisory management in the southwest often mandate 50 hour work weeks to their staff in order to meet year-end goals.  Managing this type of lifestyle is not always easy and is typically the reason why people leave for other jobs."

After 1 to 2 years the work is not challenging and your career becomes tedious task management.  This task management steadily increases until you become Sr. Manager when you can delegate these tasks, concentrate more on the sale of work you may not be comfortable delivering, and manage frustrated staff from afar.  


If you do not have strong character and work hard enough to be kept around the following will happen: The longer you are around the more tainted you become with this whole selling the image theme and lose sight of actually delivering value internally and to clients.  Then if you stay around too long there is not a good exit strategy because the pay is higher than a job you can get in industry or consulting given your limited skillset.  So you are stuck with a limited skillset and praying for SOX 2.0 until that day comes when you make partner and have to live your new life under the microscope like a preacher or politician."

- If you are unfortunate enough to fall into teams that are not doing well, you are likely to be resourced on to projects that have nothing to do with your role (advisory employees resourced on audit or tax) - in other words a waste of your expertise. 
- This also means that partners are likely to sell whatever they can, even in an area that they have no expertise in. This usually leads to under-resourcing and not being able to deliver a quality output as expected by the client. 
- interesting and stimulating projects are rare. For example in advisory, you are very likely to be resourced onto PMO roles formatting the same deck every week. 
- There has been a push for mental health initiatives but high pressure on utilisation and demanding project means that you are likely to not be able to attend any of those sessions.

Because of the rapid growth, there is a very open dialogue between the Partners, MDs, managers and associates about where the firm/team has been and where it is going.  In a lot of ways, the environment within the advisory group is similar to that of a startup because people are constantly being hired, new clients are always being sought after and signed, and the group is experiencing double digit growth in terms of revenue and headcount. 

The work experience is top notch.  The clients and nature of the work you are exposed to is excellent, and your ability to make an impact on the final product is huge because deal teams are small (3-5 people).  You'll learn a lot if you are proactive enough.","The downside of all the growth happening is that it is easy to fall between the cracks.  You really need to be proactive and look for your own work to be on by politicking with your peers, otherwise you won't get picked up on work.  The general composition of the group is 25 to 30-somethings that are all single and act like they're still in college.  The people in the San Francisco office in particular tend to take themselves too seriously and have a bit of an elitist attitude because the majority of the clients are private equity, and therefore they think that they are somehow working in private equity (they're not).    This is a well-documented fact amongst the group, as you can often hear other surrounding offices and advisory teams mention that they generally don't like to work out of the San Francisco office or with San Francisco-based due diligence folks."

It is faster to work yourself up at the firm than work your way up in industry. If you stay focused on that, it is worth putting in your time with the firm.","The biggest downside is the demanding pressures of constantly trying to balance work and life. This is especially difficult if you are married and/or have kids. Although the firm preaches work/life ""balance"", this really is not the case. You can only focus 100% on one or the other. You can only be an EP at work or home--you choose. Usually, you justify working those insane long hours and missing school events by believing that all this sacrafice is for your family's future.

Case 1:
Has worked with one Senior Manager for one big engagement and yet he is totally slacking off. He did not visit the client premises for the whole 3 month audit. Submitted files for him to review and he will gladly click ""Reviewed"" yet knows nothing about the company. Incompetent to the extent that he has no principles at all, subservient to client demand eventhough partner disagrees. So it's left to the senior to clean up the mess.

Extremely demanding and petty manager.  A technical sound manager which holds everybody to his high expectation. Yet he himself is slow in producing workpapers and can only blame the team for everything."
